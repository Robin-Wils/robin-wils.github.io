are rather vague words. It is hard to give these words a correct meaning, but I
gave it a try.</p><p>Social media is a part of the media nowadays and many people use the media to
impact others. It is the best way to reach people.</p><p>Social media and the media aren&rsquo;t so different. You can only see a bit of the
world at the time, in other words, people have an impact on you all the time.</p><figure><img src=../../../images/articles/media-and-social-media/social-media-binoculars.jpg alt="A screen which shows a man using binoculars.

Social networking is usually included in this full package.</p><p>I mean the part in which people chat or talk with others when I use the word
social networking. Social networking applications are things like IRC, email,
videocalls and chatting.</p><p>Some might see these things as social media, but I see it as a different thing.</p><h2 id=research-shows-us>Research shows us</h2><h3 id=social-media>Social media</h3><p>Social media is similar to (or is) a drug and can be bad for your health.</p><blockquote><p>" Around one-third of humans on the planet are using social media, and some of
these people are displaying maladaptive, excessive use of these sites. "</p><p>&ndash; Dar Meshi (lead author and assistant professor at MSU)</p></blockquote><div class=small-font><div></div><p>Research source:

Verdejo-Garcia;<br>Published in: Journal of behavioral addictions;</p></div><h3 id=social-networking>Social networking</h3><p>There is research about the positive sides of social networking. Someone who
uses a social networking site might be more likely to avoid serious
psychological distress.</p><div class=small-font><div></div><p>Research source:

Kuss and Mark D. Griffiths;<br>Published in: International journal of environmental research and public health;</p></div><p>Keep in mind that I don&rsquo;t see social networking as social media. Social
networking is a smaller package.</p><h2 id=social-media-disadvantages>Social media disadvantages</h2><p>That research might have shown you, why social media is probably not healthy
and addicting, but it has even more disadvantages.</p><p>There is even a video of the founding president of Facebook who claims that
they make it addicting and that they always knew this.</p><div title="Sean Parker : The secret behind Facebook."><div></div><p>Watch on <a href="https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=XyMlE8r3Jek" rel=external>invidio.us</a></p></div><blockquote><p>" It’s a social-validation feedback loop&mldr; exactly the kind of thing that a
hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a
vulnerability in human psychology. "</p><p>" The inventors, creators &ndash; it&rsquo;s me, it&rsquo;s Mark, it&rsquo;s Kevin Systrom on
Instagram, it&rsquo;s all of these people &ndash; understood this, consciously. And we did
it anyway. "</p><p>&ndash; Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook</p></blockquote><h3 id=fake-news>Fake news</h3><p>It usually contains a lot of propaganda and lies. It can contain some truths as
well, but many people also believe the lies, since they don&rsquo;t have the time or
are too lazy to do some research.</p><p>People get paid to promote stuff. Social media is still a marketing tool. The
media also has this problem.</p><h3 id=privacy-problems>Privacy problems</h3><p>Many people including kids, probably don&rsquo;t read the extreme policies which you
accept by making a social media account.</p><p>Some policies of the popular Facebook network allow them to:</p><ul><li>Use all the information which they receive about you. That includes things
which you haven&rsquo;t done yet. Nothing you do on Facebook is private. (This
gives them permission to constantly spy on you);</li><li>Collect information about things which you do after you leave their website;</li><li>Use your identity, even in ads;</li><li>Give your data to partners. Partners can mean a lot;</li></ul><p>Keep in mind that this isn&rsquo;t even everything. I recommend the &ldquo;Terms of
Service; Didn’t Read&rdquo; add-on if you want to see the Words of Service in a more
readable format.</p><h4 id=terms-of-service-didn-t-read>Terms of Service; Didn&rsquo;t Read</h4><p>This extension informs you instantly of your rights online by showing an

many people don&rsquo;t realize how much time social media really takes. Not much (if
even anything) is worth living a life that you wouldn’t like. Nothing is worth
putting aside what you have always wanted to be.</p><h2 id=good-reasons-to-use-social-media>Good reasons to use social media</h2><h3 id=is-using-it-to-stay-in-contact-with-others-any-good>Is using it to stay in contact with others any good?</h3><p>Using it to have contact with others is a bad reason in my opinion.</p><p>People who care about you shouldn&rsquo;t abandon you if you care about your privacy
and/or your health when you move to a different platform. It might be less easy
to use, but that shouldn&rsquo;t matter.</p><p>Your good friends will try to stay in touch in some other way. Your other
&ldquo;friends&rdquo;, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t trust them too much. People use others to
reach their goals all the time.</p><p>Social media is probably not going away soon. It is important to know your
limit if you decide to use that poison. Test what it does to you if you spend a
few weeks without social media.</p><p>I feel better in general when I stop using social media for a while. Do what
feels right in the long run and play with the options. How much time on social
media is too much?</p><h3 id=to-influence-people>To influence people</h3><p>This is the only good reason that I could find to use social media. Influencing
people is useful when you try to sell a product or an idea.</p><p>It is just the fastest and easiest way to market something. Many people use it
and it works. There are other ways though. I add share links, so that I don&rsquo;t
have to have an account on those platforms.</p><p>My share links don&rsquo;t use any tracking JavaScript, since I don&rsquo;t find it ethical
to track users.</p><h2 id=share-buttons>Share buttons</h2><p>The Facebook like buttons violate the GDPR and I bet that it isn&rsquo;t the only
social media button which tracks everything you do, even if you don&rsquo;t have a
Facebook account. This is a reason why some people like myself often block
JavaScript.</p><p>I added custom share links for these platforms. Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t use the
buttons which these platforms provide. I cares about your privacy. It is just
a way to get my content to the people who aren&rsquo;t aware of these problems.</p><p>Keep in mind that <strong>I don&rsquo;t recommend you to stay on those closed source
platforms!</strong> I don&rsquo;t recommend it, since you give them an extra user. These
platforms only exist because of their users (and usually also the personal data
of those users).</p><figure><img src=../../../images/articles/media-and-social-media/facebook-pills.jpg alt="A opened box of big white pills. The label of this box says 'Facebook'." width=400 height=267></figure><div class=small-font><div></div><p>Facebook pills, I couldn&rsquo;t find the original creator of the picture - CC0
licensed.</p></div><h2 id=social-networking>Social networking</h2><h3 id=social-networking>Social networking</h3><p>I already mentioned why it is probably a better choice as social media&mldr; but
it also has some disadvantages.</p><h3 id=disadvantages>Disadvantages</h3><p>The current most used social networking platform is probably email. Email has a
lot of problems, but most people still use it because it is easy to use.</p><p>Some, but far from all of those problems are spam. It is easy to spoof(fake) an
email address and it is not encrypted by default. No encryption by default
means that anyone who uses a packet analyzer on your network can see and read
the contents of your emails.</p><p>Email is easy to use because the most people have it. It also isn&rsquo;t too hard to
use. Many sites use email to validate your account. Disposable email services
exist if you don&rsquo;t want to share your email with a website.</p><h3 id=is-it-possible-to-not-have-these-problems>Is it possible to not have these problems?</h3><p><strong>It depends.</strong></p><p>The problem is that good alternatives exist, but the communities are a bit
small, so the norm isn&rsquo;t using these platforms yet. This makes it harder to
find people to have conversations with.</p><p>You can use these alternatives which might fix many of the problems which email
has as a solution.</p><h3 id=tips-for-new-social-networking-platforms>Tips for new social networking platforms</h3><p>Email is something which most people have, because most people need it to
validate themselves on websites. Make sure that your social networking platform
has something like that.</p><p>Mark my words, email will probably stop being used some day. It could be your
platform that replaces it. Think about how you can make it attractive to the
norm.</p><div id=social-media-links><p><strong>Share</strong></p><p class=link-list><a href="https://share.diasporafoundation.org/?url=https%3a%2f%2fpages.codeberg.org%2fRobinWils%2fcategories%2farticles%2fmedia-and-social-media%2f" rel="external nofollow">Diaspora</a>
