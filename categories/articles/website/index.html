This man is named Robin Wils." width=120 height=120></figure><p>I am a free (as in freedom) software enthusiast from Belgium.
I like software that respects your freedom. This does not mean
that I don&rsquo;t respect people who use closed source software.</p><p>Everything that someone does or uses is a choice and I
believe that people have a reason for why they do something.
It is not always a good reason, but I accept it. I don&rsquo;t
know their life.</p><p>You might be able to get to know me when you read this website.
There are many things which could describe me.</p><h3 id=why-is-this-website-so-simple>Why is this website so simple?</h3><h4 id=the-readers>The readers</h4><p>My readers might like simple things. It makes it easier to read for many
people, since there aren&rsquo;t too many distractions.</p><p>It could be even simpler, but I want that it works and that it is easy to use
for the most people. Making it too minimal would take away that it is easy to
use.</p><p>I will also provide some other <a href=../../../about/website-themes>themes</a> in case you don&rsquo;t like the style of this
website.</p><h4 id=it-is-fast>It is fast</h4><p>It could still load fast if I would have added more styles or even JavaScript.
There is a difference between a page which loads extremely fast and a page
which loads fast. This website should be readable on slow internet connections
unlike many other sites.</p><h4 id=it-is-easier-to-manage>It is easier to manage</h4><p>Adding more elements means that you also have to manage those elements.</p><h4 id=it-works-on-many-browsers>It works on many browsers</h4><p>This website should work on text-based browsers, unlike many other websites. It
won&rsquo;t work on very old browsers, since it uses HTML5.</p><p>HTML5 should make the website easier to read for people who use screen readers.
I want that this website works for the biggest group of people. That includes
people with reading problems.</p><h4 id=it-is-privacy-friendly>It is privacy friendly</h4><p>Many websites and ads track you. I don&rsquo;t like programs which spy on users and
many other people don&rsquo;t like that either.</p><h3 id=website-themes>Website themes</h3><h4 id=install-a-theme>Install a theme</h4><p>You can install a theme by installing the Stylus add-on on your browser, and
by adding one of the listed themes to the add-on by clicking on the name of
the theme.</p><ul><li><p>Dark theme</p><p>The default theme can change based on your theme settings. This is a pretty
new feature and won&rsquo;t work on every browser. I made a stylus theme for it
as well.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Stylus add-on</p><p>License: GPLv3</p><div class=link-list><div></div><p><a href=https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us title="Add Stylus to firefox" rel="external nofollow">Firefox</a>

browsers. This style was made for the browsers which don’t support the
dark theme feature yet.</p><p>Author: Robin Wils</p><p>License: CC0</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id=add-your-own-theme>Add your own theme</h4><p>All the themes are on a repository on Codeberg. You can request me to add your
theme to the repository.</p><h3 id=religion>Religion</h3><h4 id=religion>Religion</h4><p>I am an Atheist just because I have never seen a God. I am not saying that
something like it could not exist. The universe is big.</p><p>It is good to question some things. Many things which people find normal aren&rsquo;t
one of the better ways to do something. Look at keyboard layouts for example.</p><p>I do believe in karma, so I believe that doing good things will bring you good
things and that doing bad things will bring you bad things. I also just don&rsquo;t
see the purpose of not trying to live your life righteous.</p><h4 id=philosophical>Philosophical</h4><p>I believe that everyone supports someone&rsquo;s ideas, not the person. It is hard to
say that you really support someone completely. This is more philosophical as
religious.</p><p>I try to have no enemies, but others might see me as a enemy. Supporting one
idea usually means that you are against another idea.</p><p>Like Bryan Lunduke would say &ldquo;Be excellent to each other&rdquo;. It might be easier
said as done.</p><p>You could try to view everyone as equal and treat them that way. The truth is,
we all have different talents. We are not equal. I, however try to stay polite.</p><p>I like to think about psychological things. You can find some of those things
in my articles, but it might not be obvious.</p><h3 id=pets>Pets</h3><p>I like pets and we have two dogs in our house. Their names are Faye and Sienna.
They come from an animal shelter. The dog on the left is Sienna, the other dog
is Faye.</p><figure><img src=../../../images/dogsFayeAndSienna.jpg alt="Two dogs next to each other." width=350 height=266></figure><p><a href=../../../pictures/dog-pictures/>More dog pictures</a></p><h3 id=drugs>Drugs</h3><p>I try to not use drugs but I am not against people who use drugs. The only drug
I currently do from time to time is caffeine as in coffee or energy drinks. I
would take medication when I get sick which is also a drug.</p><p>I believe that drugs are not always bad and can even be useful in some cases.
It is good for your health to avoid most drugs, but not all. Medication can be
important.</p><p>Decide for your own if you want to use certain drugs. Many drugs have nasty
after-effects which you probably want to avoid.</p><p>I currently prefer tea over coffee. Tea can also contain caffeine, but it is
usually not as much caffeine as coffee. Health matters. Time is limited and
bad health can make it even more limited.</p><h3 id=why-i-avoid-politics-in-most-places>Why I avoid politics in most places</h3><h4 id=people-start-to-assume-things>People start to assume things</h4><p>I rather have my own opinions than being associated with what I voted for.
People who disagree with the party which you voted for might hate you because
they think that you agree with this or that.</p><h4 id=it-takes-time>It takes time</h4><p>Talking about politics takes time. There is a time a place to talk about it,
but I find that it often brings more problems as solutions. I don&rsquo;t even
follow the media, since most things are lies and propaganda. Searching for
the truth can take a lot of your time. I prefer to use my time for things
which I find more important.</p><p>There are people with which I can talk about politics, but those people are
people who dare to question things. They research to find the truth because
they are very interested in politics. I am just not that interested in
politics.</p><p>What you vote for is often none of people their business in the first place,
so why would you waste a ton of time on such a topic?</p><h4 id=not-everyone-understands-you>Not everyone understands you</h4><p>You vote for things which matter to you. It is possible that you are like me
and that you don&rsquo;t stand for some party. I prefer to think in ideas, not in
people or parties. I believe that you can&rsquo;t completely agree with someone.</p><p>You can try to explain why you vote for something, but discussions like that
can take a ton of time. I think that every party has some problems. It isn&rsquo;t
possible to have something which everyone agrees with.</p><h4 id=you-can-t-avoid-politics>You can&rsquo;t avoid politics</h4><p>Yes, that is correct. There is politics in everything, but talking about
some problems usually brings more trouble than it is worth in my opinion. It
also depends on the person which you are talking with.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to associate myself with some person or party. It is pretty
impossible to not talk about politics in some way. Talking about big problems
is usually not worth your time in my opinion. Unless that person has done
enough research. You also have to be in the right place at the right time.</p><h4 id=so-which-party-did-robin-wils-vote-for>So, which party did Robin Wils vote for?</h4><p>I won&rsquo;t give you the answer, since I don&rsquo;t stand for any party and I don&rsquo;t
want to create a long discussion. I prefer to keep it secret and my opinion
can change from year to year.</p><h3 id=music>Music</h3><h4 id=what-i-don-t-like>What I don&rsquo;t like</h4><p>I usually don&rsquo;t judge people by what they listen to. I usually won&rsquo;t complain
about your music taste. Everyone likes different stuff. There are some genres
which I don&rsquo;t like though.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t like dubstep, hardcore, house and other noisy background beats. Don&rsquo;t
confuse this with Classical music, Jazz or other genres. I enjoy those music
genres. I usually don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;pop&rdquo; either, but there are exceptions to the
rule.</p><h4 id=what-i-do-like>What I do like</h4><ul><li><p>Nerdcore</p><p>I enjoy Nerdcore, keep in mind that Nerdcore isn&rsquo;t always hip hop. The part of
the Nerdcore genre that I listen to is mostly hip hop though. Nerdcore is a
culture. It can include many genres.</p><p>I almost always listen to Nerdcore when I listen to music.</p><ul><li>YTCracker</li><li>Schäffer the Darklord (STD)</li><li>Mikal kHill</li><li>Ryako</li><li>LEX the Lexicon Artist</li><li>Dual Core</li><li>MC Frontalot</li><li>&mldr;</li></ul><p>I also listen to artists which aren&rsquo;t on the previous list. I mean, I could
mention them all, but the page would get filled pretty quick.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Hip hop</p><p>There is a ton of hip hop, which I actually don&rsquo;t like, but there are
exceptions.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t often listen to these artists, but I usually play their song once when
they release a new song. I do enjoy their music, but my love for Nerdcore is
bigger.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong though, there are a lot of great artists out there.</p><ul><li>The Jokerr</li><li>Some artists of strange music:<ul><li>Tech N9ne</li><li>Wrekonize</li><li>¡MAYDAY!</li><li>Krizz Kaliko</li><li>Prozak</li><li>&mldr;</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Alternative rock, Indie rock</p><ul><li>Bôa - A band which I discovered through &ldquo;Serial Experiments Lain&rdquo;, one of the
only animes that I have seen. I liked that anime. It has something nerdy. I
also like many of the background music of that anime.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Progressive rock</p><ul><li>Pink Floyd - A pretty well known band which I like to listen to as well.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Classical</p><p>First of all, I haven&rsquo;t studied or researched any music. I just mention the
music which I enjoy.</p><ul><li>Johann Sebastian Bach</li><li>Achille-Claude Debussy</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Other music</p><ul><li>Some of the music which Twin Peaks uses</li><li>&mldr;</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id=what-is-free-software>What is free software?</h3><p>This video might be useful to get to know what free software means. It is more
complex as in the video, but the video should be good enough to learn the

The good sides are greater as the bad sides for me. I have been a long time
Debian-based distro user and I like stability. I also like up to date packages
though.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have installation scripts for my current configuration for Arch. I
have that for Devuan.

those internet jokes - CC0 licensed.</p></div><p>People often say that rolling is not stable. There is some truth in that, but
I haven&rsquo;t had any problems with that yet. I actually find it more stable.
Probably because I used some specific things like virtualbox repositories and
custom builded packages like Emacs on Devuan.</p><p>I recommend to keep the system minimal. Having many packages causes that you
have a higher chance on problems with broken packages.</p><h4 id=i-don-t-like-systemd>I don&rsquo;t like systemd</h4><p>I disabled many default systemd services which I don&rsquo;t need. I find that
systemd does too much. It also broke my networking service. I had to
install the dhclient package even though I already had dhcpcd. That fixed
my networking problems. My network manager, wicd worked perfectly fine on
Devuan.</p><p>I know that Artix (Arch without systemd) exists. The problem is compatibility
with the AUR. Most packages expect that you have systemd. It is better to just
use systemd to avoid package conflicts with the AUR.</p><h4 id=the-arch-way>The Arch Way</h4><p>I often don&rsquo;t recommend to install Arch &ldquo;The Arch Way&rdquo;. People want convenience.
Using the commandline to install your distro can be great, but it often costs
people valuable time. Most people won&rsquo;t need most commands which you use during
the install.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong installing it through the commandline can be fast and has
advantages. Many Arch users say taht you should only use Arch if you do the
commandline install. I don&rsquo;t agree.</p><p>Doing it to learn the commands is understandable, but I would recommend to try
Linux From Scratch in a virtual machine instead if you want to learn much.</p><ul><li><p>Arch installers</p><ul><li><p>Arch Zen Installer</p><p>The Zen Installer provides a full graphical (point and click) environment for
installing Arch Linux. It can even detect and install the video drivers which

People have taken a
picture of my keyboard and posted it on 9gag. They did this without asking
because it looks weird. Yes, I know 9gag&mldr; a closed source website which
contains internet jokes.</p><h4 id=why-would-anyone-use-this-layout>Why would anyone use this layout?</h4><figure><img src=../../../images/about/dvorak-layout.jpg alt="A picture of the Dvorak keyboard layout." width=400 height=133></figure><div class=small-font><div></div><p>Picture of the Dvorak layout - CC0 licensed.</p></div><p>Well, look at it like this. We use QWERTY since people created that for
typewriters so people knew the layout already. A typewriter needed a special
layout like QWERTY since typewriters work with metal arms and those could jam.</p><p>People created the Dvorak layout to replace QWERTY. That layout claims to
require less finger movement which is also why many people claim that your
typing speed increases when you use Dvorak. I find the Dvorak layout very
comfortable to type on. I don&rsquo;t use it to improve my typing speed. I do touch
type though.</p><h4 id=security>Security</h4><p>Not everyone knows how to type on a Dvorak keyboard layout. This means that
some cybercriminals also don&rsquo;t know the layout. It is not a lot of extra
security, but everything that helps, helps.</p><h4 id=world-s-fastest-typist>World&rsquo;s fastest typist</h4><p>The world&rsquo;s current fastest typist is Barbara Blackburn. She broke the world
record by using a Dvorak keyboard.</p><h4 id=possible-dvorak-problems>Possible Dvorak problems</h4><p>Many people who use Dvorak (including me) forget how to type on their other
keyboard layout (QWERTY for example).</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t always a problem. I recommend to get a external keyboard which can
emulate Dvorak and QWERTY. It makes life easier for your colleagues and also
for you when you have to work on other people their machines.</p><h4 id=ergodox-ez>ErgoDox EZ</h4><p>I am a proud owner of an ErgoDox EZ keyboard. It is expensive, but it is worth
it. The only problem that I have with this keyboard is that I love it too much.
Typing on a non-ergonomic keyboard like the keyboard which my laptop has is
not as comfortable. I also miss my keyboard shortcuts and layers on other
keyboards.</p><p>The ErgoDox EZ keyboard can emulate other layouts so I can emulate QWERTY.
This is very useful when I have to use a virtual machine. Some virtual
machines are preconfigured with the QWERTY layout. I can use this keyboard
to emulate QWERTY so that I can easily change the default keyboard layout
of the virtual machine to Dvorak.</p><p>Keep in mind that the ErgoDox is not perfect. The thumb keys are not easy
to press. I recommend the kinesis keyboard if you do want great thumb keys.
They are a bit better. Still not perfect, but better reachable. Xah Lee has
written a lot of stuff about keyboards. I recommend to read his <a href=http://xahlee.info/kbd/keyboarding.html rel="external nofollow">keyboard guide</a>

Linux is the most used kernel and GNU
is a common set of tools.</p><ul><li><p>Why GNU+Linux is not the correct word</p><p>Systems with BusyBox instead of GNU, systems which use the GNU Hurd kernel and
many other systems exist. Calling those systems GNU+Linux isn&rsquo;t completely
correct, is it?</p><p>There are also many other things which run on your system. You probably won&rsquo;t
put them all into the name of the operating system. It is just not convenient
to say such a huge name.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Why Linux is not the correct word</p><p>Linux is just the kernel in theory. You don&rsquo;t call Windows, Window NT kernel
and you don&rsquo;t call Mac OS X, XNU.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>From a marketing perspective</p><p>I think that the word Linux often is easier to market. It is obvious that both
words are used to market something. GNU likes the word GNU+Linux, since it
gives the GNU project credit. I like the GNU tools, so I also use that word if
I have to pick one of the those two words.</p><p>Linux is what people know. I don&rsquo;t think that it is bad to use that word. I
do think that none of both words are correct for the reasons which I described
in this article.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Solution</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have a great solution for this naming problem, but I like to call it a
distro. I usually use the distro name when I talk about a system. I use the
word GNU+Linux as well.</p><p>The distro name might be the clearest thing that you can use. Another option is
to just call the operating systems, distros. Distro is also not the best word,
since it could mean a set of software components.</p></li></ul><h4 id=what-about-calling-it-unix-like-systems>What about calling it UNIX-like systems?</h4><p>The UNIX philosophy was made by AT&T which was a closed source company. GNU

<a href=#the-bad-batch-movie--2016>The Bad Batch</a></div><ul><li><p>Firefly series and Serenity movie</p><p>Sci-Fi, Drama serie. It is probably the best Sci-Fi thing I saw.
I can&rsquo;t recommend this enough. The series follows a spaceship called
Serenity.</p><p>The Serenity movie is great as well.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Ex Machina movie</p><p>Sci-Fi thriller movie about a programmer who gets selected to participate
in an experiment to test a highly advanced humanoid android.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Serial Experiments Lain anime series</p><p>This series follow a middle school girl and her introduction to the
wired, something similar to the Internet.</p><p>It is a wonderful, cyberpunk, psychological anime. I love it.
The music is great too. I can&rsquo;t recommend this enough.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Short Circuit movies</p><p>Comedy, Sci-Fi movies about a military robot which gains a humanlike
intelligence, which it wants to explore.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Blade Runner 2049 movie (2017)</p><p>A sequel to the 1982 Blade Runner movie.</p><p>I liked this movie, but I did not like Blade Runner: The Final Cut. This
one was alright, even though it had much action. It was interesting.</p><p>Very cyberpunk styled movie.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Star Trek series and movies</p><p>I never really liked Star Wars it was too much action for me.
Sure it is well-made, but I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it.</p><p>Star Trek focuses more on the characters in a spaceship, less on
action and fighting.</p><p>There is fighting in Star Trek, but it isn&rsquo;t about fighting. It is
about maintaining the peace. I like it.</p><ul><li><p>The Original Series</p><p>I loved the original series. It was funny and interesting.
My favorite captian, so far is the original one, captain Kirk.</p><p>I also love the characters which don&rsquo;t get that much screen time like
Sulu. I really liked his acting.</p><p>The first episode was also so great. I didn&rsquo;t expect to like Star Trek,
but I was enjoying it. It was a pretty clever episode, or at least more
clever than I expected.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Next Generation</p><p>I liked the original series more, but this was entertaining too. It is
cool that it managed to be alright.</p><p>People usually don&rsquo;t like change, so I think that &ldquo;The Next Generation&rdquo;
did a fantastic job.</p><p>The new Characters and parts of the ship are pretty cool. I do like the
Characters of the original Star Trek more though. They are just a bit
more funny, less serious.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Deep Space Nine</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t seen this yet.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</p><p>The only movie from Star Trek which I really liked. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong
though. Some of the other movies were alright too.</p><p>The first one was not that enjoyable to me and anything after
Star Trek: Nemesis didn&rsquo;t do it for me, but I watched it completely.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t like Nemesis. Too much shooting, it feels more like how I
remember Star Wars (much action).</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t watch the movies after 2009. Star Trek ﻿2009 really didn&rsquo;t
do it for me. I even turned it off and didn&rsquo;t watch it completely.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Ergo Proxy anime series</p><p>Great cyberpunk anime. It was very enjoyable, but Serial Experiments
Lain is my favorite.</p><p>The story follows Re-l who is assigned to investigate some murders with
her android partner Iggy.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>A Space Odyssey movies</p><p>Overall a great movie. Not everyone likes the ending though.
I really love the style of the movie and the ending too.</p><p>It is a beautiful movie about space.
I haven&rsquo;t seen 2010 yet, which is the sequel.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Wargames (1983)</p><p>A young kid connects to a secret computer which is much more important
than he things.</p><p>It is a movie for computernerds in some ways though.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Doctor Who series</p><p>Pretty interesting series. I haven&rsquo;t seen all episodes though.
It is good for a few seasons, but so many seasons exist. It manages
to stay somewhat interesting.</p><p>It is about a Time Lord called the Doctor who travels through time
and space in a blue police box (public telephone kiosk), called the
TARDIS. It a ship, not an actual police box.</p><p>I would recommend it, but also make time for other series and movies.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Matrix movies</p><p>I loved the first movie, but the second movie was too much action focused.
The second movie wasn&rsquo;t that bad though. It is a pretty cool movie.</p><p>Cyberpunk themed movie with a great story.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Back to the Future movies</p><p>It is about a scientist and and teenager who travel back in time.
These movies were enjoyable and pretty cool.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Bad Batch movie (2016)</p><p>Sci-Fi thriller movie. I did like this movie, but it wasn&rsquo;t perfect.
It has some cyberpunk elements though. It is a bit slow, but it was
alright.</p><p>The reviews aren&rsquo;t that great, but the movie was alright in my opinion.</p></li></ul><h4 id=comedy-series-and-movies>Comedy series and movies</h4><div class=link-list><div></div><a href=#monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-movie>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a>

It is scary and has dark humor. Absolutely loved it. It is one of the best
horror movies in my opinion.</p><p>This is from someone who usually does not like zombie movies, and this
movie has zombies.</p><p>It has the typical gore effects from Peter Jackson though.
Be warned, it contains gore and you might not like that.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t think that he can&rsquo;t do horror because he directed Lord of The
Rings. This movie is at the top of this list for a reason.</p><p>You probably will like

It is really good.
I haven&rsquo;t seen the remake, but it is probably not better than the original.</p><p>These movies are about &ldquo;The Thing&rdquo;, yes that is all the information that
I am giving.</p><p>Watch or download <a href=https://archive.org/details/thethingt00 rel="external nofollow">The Thing (1982)</a> for free (archive.org)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</p><p>You probably have heard about leatherface, but have you seen any of the
movies? I saw the first one, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and it
was actually really good.</p><p>The acting in the first movie is really good and the movie looks pretty
beautiful too. I mean the setting and and the recording style.</p><p>I probably will watch more movies of the franchise.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Gremlins</p><p>A comedy horror movie about taking care of a small creature called mogwai
(which actually means devil).</p><p>This is one of the first horror movies I saw and, honestly it is one
of the best ones in my opinion. It is not that scary, but it is original.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Dark Skies (2013)</p><p>Dark Skies is a horror movie that knows how to build suspense. It
is a pretty spooky movie.</p><p>I guess that the skies are dark. I can&rsquo;t say much about this movies
without spoiling too much.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>We Are What We Are (2013)</p><p>This horror movie was great, but probably because I watched it without
knowing anything about it. I highly recommend doing the same, reading
about the movie would ruin it.</p><p>It is a remake of a Mexican movie with the same name. The original
might be better. It has a lower rating though. I haven&rsquo;t seen the
original.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Alien (1979)</p><p>The original Alien has a good atmosphere. I think that it is a great
movie. It is about a spaceship which is on a return trip to Earth.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t like the movies which I saw from Aliens vs Predator
though. I don&rsquo;t remember which ones I saw.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t seen Aliens yet, but might some day.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>A Nightmare on Elm Street</p><p>I loved these movies. Oh and look up some behind the scenes of it.
It is incredibly well made for its time. I love it.</p><p>I found it more like dark humor than horror, but I still love it a ton.
I don&rsquo;t recommend the remake though. I also really love how well
Robert Englund played Freddy.</p><p>It is about a man who haunts people in their dreams. Also the lines of
the killer are pretty amazing.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Phantasm</p><p>Sci-Fi horror movie francise about a tall man with supernatural powers.
He has epic flying metal balls too, well, more than just balls,
but you have to watch it for more information.</p><p>Ah, a fun fact. The internet character Slender Man was inspired by the
Tall Man. A Nightmare on Elm Street also had some influence from Phantasm.</p><p>It is an entertaining movie, something like A Nightmare on Elm Street.
but th.</p><ul><li><p>The story is just great</p><p>The movie starts where the last one ended and you discover more and more
secrets through the movies. The main characters are pretty fun too.</p><p>The story is very interesting in my opinion, just because it has many
secrets. It is also very freaking random, but I loved that.</p><p>The music is pretty damn good too. The fourth movie was probably my favorite.
Phantasm: Ravager (2016, the last one) was cool, but it also had some bad
sides. It was probably my least favorite movie of the francise.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>You might want to skip the first movie</p><p>I recommend to skip the first movie. There are references to
the first movie, but I found it a weak movie compared to the others,
but it is still a pretty great movie.</p><p>It is a good watch it for some more back story. I would recommend to
watch it after the second movie if you want to see it. Life is
fun because of the secrets.</p><p>The first movie explains some of the secrets, but not too much either.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>It is a classic</p><p>This francise is a cult classic. It isn&rsquo;t super well-known, but it is
known. It is one of the lowest grossing horror films if you compare it
with other famous horror movies.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Little Shop of Horrors (1986)</p><p>Horror comedy musical movie about a plant shop.
There is obviously something weird going on in the plant shop.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Re-Animator</p><p>Comedy horror movies about a doctor which reanimates animals and more.</p><p>I have only the first one and it was alright. The last one is apparently
not that great, the second one should be alright too.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Hellraiser</p><p>The first few movies were really good, but I didn&rsquo;t like the later ones.
The concept and music is pretty great. I didn&rsquo;t found it scary, but I
found it entertaining.</p><p>It is also pretty well made if you like at some behind the scenes stuff.
Doug Bradley also plays the role of pinhead well.</p><p>Nothing beats &ldquo;A Nightmare on Elm Street&rdquo; for me, when it comes to
watching horror classics for entertainment, but Hellraiser is not
bad at all.</p><p>This movie is about a puzzlebox which is somehow related to
extra-dimensional beings.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Collector and The Collection</p><p>These movies contained gore and torture, but the way that it did was
pretty well done. This is not for everyone and is pretty gore.</p><p>It is about some man which likes to collects people as a hobby. It is
just something which some people do apparently.</p><p>Somethings are not realistic at all though, but I like it a ton more
than the original Saw.</p><p>I also realised that The Collector (2009) movie that I saw wasn&rsquo;t the
original. The original seems great as well.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Grudge</p><p>It is too bad that I haven&rsquo;t seen Ju-On: The Grudge, the original
Japanese one. It is probably even better than the ones I saw.</p><p>I saw the one from 2004, they apparently rebooted it again in 2020.
I usually don&rsquo;t recommend remakes, watch the original one. It is often
better.</p><p>I liked the movies it can be compared to Grave Encounters and Insidious
in a way. The story isn&rsquo;t great, but the movie was pretty well-made.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t like The Ring, but I haven&rsquo;t seen the original Japanese, Ring
movie which is probably good.</p><p>These movies use many jumpscares, but the noises which the Grudge makes
are creepy too. I haven&rsquo;t seen any of the following links.</p><p>Watch or download <a href=https://archive.org/details/JuOnTheCurseJapaneseHorrorFullMovieEnglishSubtitles rel="external nofollow">Ju-On: The Curse (2000)</a> for free (archive.org),

horrormovies. It is worth watching though.</p><p>This movie would probably make it higher in some of my other lists.
This list is ranked on how much I liked something or how scary I found
it.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the prequels &ldquo;Red Dragon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hannibal Rising&rdquo;.
I also didn&rsquo;t see the &ldquo;Hannibal&rdquo; sequel. You might want to watch those
if you liked this movie.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Saw</p><p>I only liked the story of the first Saw and didn&rsquo;t really enjoy the
other movies. I haven&rsquo;t seen them all either.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t find it scary either, some people might search for gore
instead of great stories or good atmosphere, unlike me.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The Wicker Man</p><p>I personally don&rsquo;t really recommend it, but I like how it is different.
It wasn&rsquo;t scary to me, but it had something cool.</p><p>Watch or download <a href=https://archive.org/details/The.Wicker.Man.1973.720p.BluRay.x264.YIFY>The Wicker Man (1972)</a> for free (archive.org)</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Movies to not watch</p><ul><li><p>Human Centipede</p><p>The Human Centipede focuses on gore. I have only seen the first one
and it was too predictable in my opinion.</p><p>It is known as a distrubing film and I get that but it wasn&rsquo;t scary to
me. It was just gore. It isn&rsquo;t as bad as people claim, but it is bad.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think that movies like this deserve your attention. Movies need
some form of story in my opinion, and this story was just too predictable
that it barely was like a good story in my opinion.</p><p>The second one is more disturbing than the first one apparently. They
again try to make it more disturbing in the third one.</p><p>I am not sure of they did top it with the third one, since many say that
it was a let down, but I rather watch an interesting less predictable
movie instead.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Tusk</p><p>I have seen Tusk, because the concept seemed like it could have a story.
It wasn&rsquo;t that interesting. It was obvious that it was makeup, which is
good. Although the ending was pretty interesting. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it.</p><p>It might make me look weird, but the concept was actually pretty laughable.
It had too much sex jokes too in my opinion. I don&rsquo;t recommend it. It looks
more interesting than it is.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Others</p><p>I would probably watch the Japanese Grotesque (2009) if I want to see
something disturbing. It looks like a great movie if you are looking for
that.</p><p>There are movies like A Serbian Film, Cannibal Holocaust and August
Underground trilogy that I will probably never watch.</p><p>If you ever think about watching those, read something about those movies
first and think again. They don&rsquo;t look like fun movies and these are just
the well-known ones. There might be even worse stuff out there.</p><p>Other movies like this are:<br>Guinea Pig, I Spit on Your Grave, Nekromantik, Visitor Q,
Salò (or the 120 Days of Sodom).</p><p>Look up the YouTube channel &ldquo;Nyx Fears&rdquo; if you want to see someone
ranking these. Also some not well-knows ones. I hope that she will
convince you to not watch these.</p></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id=weird-stuff-i-guess--series-and-movies>Weird stuff, I guess? (series and movies)</h4><div class=link-list><div></div><a href=#twin-peaks-series-and-movie>Twin Peaks</a>

pretty weird, but great.</p><p>Shooting through the phone and things like that are possible. It also
has some weird Characters. It is a mess of things, but it somehow
kinda works.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Hackers (1995)</p><p>Hackers is so bad and some quotable lines. It is good in group.
It is pretty quotable if you are a geek.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t laugh a lot, but seeing where the quotes come from is

Most people use Chrome.
Brave is based on Chromium and provides some extra security features like
using Tor for private windows.</p><p>It is not as secure as Tor browser and I don&rsquo;t trust Chromium either, but
I believe that all browsers currently aren&rsquo;t great for privacy.</p><p>Including Tor, even though it is still much better than many other
browsers when it comes to privacy.</p><p>It is not perfect. I2P might be better in many ways, but I haven&rsquo;t
looked into it. Not so well-known stuff is often more anonymous
unless we talk about things like browsers.</p><p>There are so many Firefox based and Chromium based browsers, but most
of them don&rsquo;t add many extra features.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>It pays you</p><p>Browsers all kinda suck when it comes to privacy, but Brave does one thing
which most other browsers don&rsquo;t do.</p><p>It pays you if you allow it to show some small notification like ads in
the corner of your screen.</p><p>Go to `brave://rewards` and make sure that the Ads slider is on and the
auto-contribute slider is off.</p><p>You have to make an uphold account to actually claim the crypto. It isn&rsquo;t
the simplest process to go through, but you get a tiny bit of crypto every
month. I get around 5 BAT a month from the notification ads.</p><p>You can get more if you allow donations in Brave Rewards. I configured it.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>What I don&rsquo;t like about it</p><ul><li>You need an Uphold account to withdraw money</li><li>I like Firefox based stuff more than Chromium based stuff. I love the
developer tools of Firefox.</li><li>I would love some more customisation. It has customisation already, but
one thing which I absolulety love about Firefox based browsers is
the `about:config` page.</li></ul><p>I would recommend abrowser if you want a Firefox based browser. It is what
I currently use to test my websites in.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Download info and donation link</p><p>You can donate to me with Brave on my Twitter and Github.</p><p>Ha, and if you would like to get donations too, you can make a Brave

Git is a system which
tracks your files, code and content.</p><p>Git is useful because it is small and it provides history, so you can
go back if you mess something up.</p><p>Gitlab and codeberg also allow you to host a static website for free.
I use that functionality for this website.</p><h4 id=so-why-did-you-move-away-from-gitlab>So why did you move away from Gitlab?</h4><ul><li><p>Gitlab is great</p><p>Gitlab was great for what I did. It provides useful pipelines, which
most other Git platforms don&rsquo;t have.</p><p>A pipeline does somethings before your website or other projects gets
build. It is useful since it does not publish your result if something
went wrong in the pipeline.</p><p>A pipeline can also contain tests and extra scripts. It is very useful.</p><p>It is also Free Software, which is why I prefer it over Github
(Github is closed source). Codeberg is Free Software as well.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Why it is no longer my choice</p><p>My reason for moving was that the <a href=../../../categories/articles/gitlab-404-pages-problem>404 pages no longer worked</a>. I was
patient, for a year. The issue still wasn&rsquo;t fixed after a year and it
could influence my SEO in a bad way.</p><p>I consider 404 pages important and every good businessperson knows that
the users are important, so they should have a good experience. Fixing
problems fast is something which users will enjoy.</p><p>A 404 page is very important for some people. Check the previous
&ldquo;404 pages no longer worked&rdquo; link for more details.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t hate Gitlab and actually enjoyed using it. In fact, I still use
it for some projects and I will use it as a backup by mirroring some of
my projects to Gitlab.</p></li></ul><h4 id=codeberg-is-even-better-in-some-ways>Codeberg is even better in some ways</h4><p>I knew that codeberg supported 404 pages, so I decided to move to
codeberg. I had used it before and it looked pretty decent.</p><ul><li><p>The migration</p><p>Some bugs popped up after migrating to codeberg&mldr;</p><p>I created an issue after looking for a fix, and guess what? The amazing
developers fixed it in less than an hour!</p><p><br></p><p>Ha, and by the way. They did this twice!</p><p>You can take a look at the <a href=https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/Community/issues/178 rel=external>closed issue</a> if you don&rsquo;t believe me.
So the first plus for codeberg is <strong><strong>great user support</strong></strong>.</p><p>That is a big plus in my opinion. (<em>This is my opinion. Oh, really is</em>
<em>it? Why did I even type this text between these brackets&mldr;</em>)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>More text</p><p>One disavantage is that it does not have pipelines, but I used that as
an advantage. I have one repository with my hugo source and one with
the result now. I use a script to push my code to the other repository.</p><p>Some advantages of codeberg:</p><ul><li>Great user support.</li><li>Actual working 404 pages.</li><li>No more Google servers. Gitlab uses the Google servers to host your
content. Some people might block the Google servers for privacy
reasons.</li><li>Support competition, codeberg isn&rsquo;t a big name yet, but it might
become one.</li><li>You can find my website source code there. (Sorry, this is a bad
joke and I mirror to Gitlab anyways.)</li></ul><p>Codeberg is a fork of Gitea. It is light and does not have as many
features as Gitlab, but it has good user support in my opinion.</p></li></ul><h3 id=gitlab-custom-404-pages-are-still-broken>Gitlab custom 404 pages are still broken</h3><h4 id=the-problem>The problem</h4><p>Custom 404 pages stopped working a year ago for <code>*.gitlab.io</code> domains. A
404 page is a page which you get when a URL can&rsquo;t be found on a website.</p><p>The <a href=https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages/-/issues/183 title="404 pages not served on Gitlab" rel="external nofollow">Gitlab issue
</a>.</p><h4 id=why-this-is-a-major-bug>Why this is a major bug</h4><ul><li><p>Frameworks and libraries are more difficult to use</p><p>Many libraries like React show incredibly useful error messages on the
404 page when stuff stops working.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>It can break the SEO for websites</p><p>SEO means how high you rank in search engines. Backlinks (links from
other websites to your website) are very important for SEO.</p><p>Those backlinks can link to a completely broken page if a website
decides to change some URLs and does not have a working 404 page.</p><p>The website should show a 404 page instead. Many of my backlinks are
going to be invalid now, which is not great.</p></li></ul><h4 id=why-this-bothers-me>Why this bothers me</h4><p>Well, it is going to affect my SEO. The issue was created last year.
I think that such an issue is way too important to ignore. It isn&rsquo;t
a minor thing.</p><h4 id=solutions>Solutions</h4><ul><li><p>Buy a domain</p><p>Another solution is buy yourself a domain and use it. It does work if
you use another domain.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Move to another platform</p><p>People are going to hate this, but moving to another platform is a
solution. Github does not have this problem.</p><p>I would suggest that you host your website there instead until Gitlab
fixes this. They will probably lose some users because of this bug, but
I overall like Gitlab.</p><p>Sure, Gitlab uses the Google servers to host your site on, but it still
feels more open than Github (which is owned by Microsoft) and it has
wonderful pipelines.</p><p>Gitlab has pipelines, which is really useful. It is a reason to move
for many people.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>What will this website do?</p><p>I might move to Github pages if this stays broken. I don&rsquo;t want to wait
much longer for 404 page support.</p><p>Codeberg had the same problem and it only took them a few hours to fix
it, not even a day. I will probably move to codeberg pages.</p><p>I migrated my site to codeberg.</p><p>Moving also means that I would lose much SEO, but it might also mean
that it might not happen again.</p></li></ul><h4 id=why-don-t-you-fix-it-yourself>Why don&rsquo;t you fix it yourself?</h4><p>Well, I have other stuff to do and I believe that Gitlab has a pretty
big codebase. It would require much time.</p><h3 id=why-i-no-longer-use-wayland>Why I no longer use Wayland</h3><h4 id=why-wayland>Why Wayland?</h4><p>Wayland is a display server. It is more secure and less complex than
Xorg. There are also some other benefits. Wayland is the future.</p><p>You can read the following article for some Wayland
tips: <a href=../../../articles/trying-wayland-and-sway>Trying Wayland and Sway</a></p><h4 id=why-not-wayland>Why not Wayland?</h4><ul><li><p>Drivers</p><p>Some drivers seem to rely on Xorg, like some drawing tablet drivers.
Some drawing tablet drivers already work though.</p><p>The closed source NVIDIA drivers are also not supported yet, but
honestly use AMD instead if you have the option.</p><p>There are many reasons to not like NVIDIA for GNU/Linux users,
but that article is for another day.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Jumpapp</p><p>Jumpapp doesn&rsquo;t works with tablayout in Sway. It does work in i3.
I highly recommend using tablayout and jumpapp. It increases my
productivity a lot.</p><p>Set some jumpapp bindings in your i3 config. Having everything
in fullscreen gives you focus. Tiling is a bit overrated in my
opinion.</p><p>It is useful to have a key to have two windows on your screen,
but having too many windows on your screen makes things complex.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Keyboard configuration</p><p>Some keyboard configuration isn&rsquo;t available on Wayland yet.
I can&rsquo;t configure Shift to do Shift lock instead on Wayland.</p><p>Swapping CapsLock with Ctrl worked though. One way around
this issue is by making your own keyboard layout. I don&rsquo;t
find that user-friendly enough.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Sharing your screen</p><p>Sharing your screen isn&rsquo;t that well-supported on Wayland yet.
Recording your screen is possible, but you need to use the
supported applications.</p></li></ul><h4 id=my-opinion>My opinion</h4><p>I do believe that Wayland will get some support and I
loved using it. Most things work and I would love to use

and/or your health when you move to a different platform. It might be less easy
to use, but that shouldn&rsquo;t matter.</p><p>Your good friends will try to stay in touch in some other way. Your other
&ldquo;friends&rdquo;, you probably shouldn&rsquo;t trust them too much. People use others to
reach their goals all the time.</p><p>Social media is probably not going away soon. It is important to know your
limit if you decide to use that poison. Test what it does to you if you spend a
few weeks without social media.</p><p>I feel better in general when I stop using social media for a while. Do what
feels right in the long run and play with the options. How much time on social
media is too much?</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>To influence people</p><p>This is the only good reason that I could find to use social media. Influencing
people is useful when you try to sell a product or an idea.</p><p>It is just the fastest and easiest way to market something. Many people use it
and it works. There are other ways though. I add share links, so that I don&rsquo;t
have to have an account on those platforms.</p><p>My share links don&rsquo;t use any tracking JavaScript, since I don&rsquo;t find it ethical
to track users.</p></li></ul><h4 id=share-buttons>Share buttons</h4><p>The Facebook like buttons violate the GDPR and I bet that it isn&rsquo;t the only
social media button which tracks everything you do, even if you don&rsquo;t have a
Facebook account. This is a reason why some people like myself often block
JavaScript.</p><p>I added custom share links for these platforms. Don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t use the
buttons which these platforms provide. I cares about your privacy. It is just
a way to get my content to the people who aren&rsquo;t aware of these problems.</p><p>Keep in mind that <strong>I don&rsquo;t recommend you to stay on those closed source
platforms!</strong> I don&rsquo;t recommend it, since you give them an extra user. These
platforms only exist because of their users (and usually also the personal data
of those users).</p><figure><img src=../../../images/articles/media-and-social-media/facebook-pills.jpg alt="A opened box of big white pills.

it also has some disadvantages.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Disadvantages</p><p>The current most used social networking platform is probably email. Email has a
lot of problems, but most people still use it because it is easy to use.</p><p>Some, but far from all of those problems are spam. It is easy to spoof(fake) an
email address and it is not encrypted by default. No encryption by default
means that anyone who uses a packet analyzer on your network can see and read
the contents of your emails.</p><p>Email is easy to use because the most people have it. It also isn&rsquo;t too hard to
use. Many sites use email to validate your account. Disposable email services
exist if you don&rsquo;t want to share your email with a website.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Is it possible to not have these problems?</p><p><strong>It depends.</strong></p><p>The problem is that good alternatives exist, but the communities are a bit
small, so the norm isn&rsquo;t using these platforms yet. This makes it harder to
find people to have conversations with.</p><p>You can use these alternatives which might fix many of the problems which email
has as a solution.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Tips for new social networking platforms</p><p>Email is something which most people have, because most people need it to
validate themselves on websites. Make sure that your social networking platform

has different servers in different locations. Websites which use Cloudflare
should be better reachable, so faster in different countries.</p><p>Cloudflare is not just a content delivery network. Cloudflare is also a
reverse proxy (= a middleman between the user and a website), a DDoS
mitigation service (= a service which tries to resist or make the impact of a
DDoS attack less painful).</p><p>Cloudflare is even more as that. Many websites are a part of the Cloudflare
content delivery network.</p><p><strong>In easy words:</strong> Cloudflare claims to try to make sites faster
and more secure. It is a service which a lot of websites use.</p><p><em>Sounds pretty nice, right?</em></p><h4 id=privacy-problems>Privacy problems</h4><p><em>Do you want to disallow people who need and deserve the right on privacy from
using your website?</em></p><p>Great! Use Cloudflare!</p><ul><li><p>Reverse proxy</p><p>A reverse proxy acts as a man-in-the-middle, which means that it <em>might</em> spy
on everything which your users do. Cloudflare is a reverse proxy.</p><p>A man-in-the-middle service is something which is between the site and the
user. This means that they can easily add JavaScript which spies on you.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>It keeps a globally-unique ID</p><p>Cloudflare creates a cookie which gives your browser a globally-unique ID.
This even happens when the website is using SSL and shows a little padlock in
your browser.</p><p>This pretty much kills privacy. A globally-unique ID can easily be used
to track you.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Tor</p><p>Cloudflare sites usually block Tor. Cloudflare does not provide you anonymity
even if it wouldn&rsquo;t block Tor. Cloudflare would let people use Tor, if they
really cared about security. Tor is made for security.</p><p>They technically don&rsquo;t always block Tor access, but the reCAPTCHAs don&rsquo;t
function correctly, which can make it hard to visit a Cloudflare site
through Tor.</p><p>You might be able to change this in the security settings for your site.
Keep in mind that most sites won&rsquo;t do this.</p><p>Source: <a href=https://blog.torproject.org/trouble-cloudflare rel="external nofollow">The Trouble with Cloudflare - Tor Blog</a></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Google CAPTCHAs</p><p>Not all sites with Cloudflare use CAPTCHAs, but many do. CAPTCHAs are the
things which try to check if you are &ldquo;human&rdquo;.</p><p>It sends your personal data to Google, since it uses the CAPTCHA from Google,
which does more than just checking if you are a robot. Some people even claim
that it tries to find out which human you are.</p><p>Remember that Google is an advertisement company. Most of their money comes
from selling your data. In fact the privacy policy which you accept by using
almost any Google product allows them to do this.</p><p>The funny thing is that there are computer programs (robots), which can solve
the &ldquo;prove you are human&rdquo; CAPTCHAs.</p><p><a href=https://policies.google.com/privacy#infocollect rel="external nofollow">Google Privacy Policy</a></p><ul><li><p>Buster</p><p>Buster is a browser extension which can solve reCaptchas. CAPTCHAs can be

that data is from innocent users who deserve privacy. Cloudflare was created
by people who worked on that project.</p><p>Cloudflare has leaked private user data before, so it has something in common
with &ldquo;Project Honey Pot&rdquo;.</p><p>Companies which don&rsquo;t show the source code probably don&rsquo;t show it for a reason.
Spying might be one of them. Showing the source code is usually a great way to
find bugs and to improve your code.</p><p>I will probably say more about this in another article.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Firefox and Cloudflare</p><p>Mozilla (Firefox) has partnered up with Cloudflare and will resolve the domain
names from the application itself via a DNS server from Cloudflare. Cloudflare
will then be able to read everyone&rsquo;s DNS requests.</p><p>You can disable it in &ldquo;about:config&rdquo;. The string value of &ldquo;network.trr.uri&rdquo;
should be empty. Some other settings can also contain Cloudflare URLs. It is
recommended to search for &ldquo;cloudflare&rdquo;. GNU Icecat and older Firefox versions
are not affected <em>yet</em>. Tor Browser is also Firefox based, but you don&rsquo;t have
to use Tor Browser to use Tor.</p><figure><img src=../../../images/articles/say-no-to-cloudflare/firefox-cloudflare-dns-settings.jpg alt="The about:config page which shows the Cloudflare DNS address in the network.trr.uri string." width=578 height=174></figure><div class=small-font><div></div><p>(Screenshot) The Firefox about:config Cloudflare
DNS settings By Robin Wils - CC0 licensed.</p></div><p>Keep in mind that the configured DNS resolver of your computer might be
Cloudflare DNS. You can find guides on the internet about setting the DNS
nameservers.</p><p>I recommend the Quad9 DNS resolver. Some of their DNS nameservers use DNSSEC,
which means that your DNS queries aren&rsquo;t in plain text. This means that it
provides you extra privacy. Quad9 is a nonprofit organisation. It looks
trustworthy enough.</p><p>Keep in mind that DNS is just a pretty insecure protocol by default.</p><p>Most GNU and/or Linux systems have a /etc/resolv.conf file, but programs like
wicd and NetworkManager change these settings. Those programs usually have a
settings menu to set the DNS nameservers.</p></li></ul><h4 id=think-about-your-visitors>Think about your visitors</h4><p><em>Do you like it when websites ruin a bit of your experience?</em></p><p>In other words: <em>Would you love to visit a website which forces you to solve a</em>
<em><strong>annoying timewasting puzzle</strong> usually after</em>
<em><strong>waiting five seconds</strong> which also cost you valuable time?</em></p><p>Awesome! Use Cloudflare!</p><ul><li><p>Your users matter</p><p>Every visitor helps. Think about their experience. They make your website
successful. They like to see your content. They probably would like it when the
website opens quickly without too many junk.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Who is your userbase&mldr; and what do they like?</p><p>Focus on them. Some of them probably care about their privacy. You will have
fewer visitors if you don&rsquo;t support them. That influences the success of your
website.</p><p>I highly doubt that they will like:</p><ul><li>To solve a CAPTCHA;</li><li>To wait for five seconds for no good reason.</li></ul><p>What possible users which care about privacy probably won&rsquo;t like:</p><ul><li>That your site isn&rsquo;t easily reachable through Tor;</li><li>That your site is hosted by some company which many people don&rsquo;t trust. (I
know that this site still uses the Google servers, I still need to fix that,
but I currently don&rsquo;t spend any money on this website.);</li><li>That the JavaScript which the site uses is necessary;</li><li>That the JavaScript isn&rsquo;t freely licensed. Some people like myself try to
use GNU LibreJS (or even disable JavaScript) when it is possible.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Just to be clear</p><p><strong>People who care about privacy aren&rsquo;t criminals</strong>, or at least not always. In
fact, <strong>everyone needs privacy</strong> in one way or another. Everyone has the right
to privacy.</p><p>People who really think that they don&rsquo;t need privacy should be ok with sending
me their address, private conversations, access to their webcam, passwords and
more. <em>Don&rsquo;t actually do this.</em></p><p>An important example are whistleblowers. They have in many cases shared useful
information. Many of them can lose their job if they aren&rsquo;t anonymous enough.</p><p>Legal &ldquo;.onion&rdquo; sites exist.

Cloudflare without any extra tools. Cloudflare is a big privacy problem. I
however have tips for the people who care about privacy.</p><ul><li><p>Extensions</p><p>There are browser extensions which fight against this problem. I recommend the
Cloud Firewall add-on.</p><ul><li><p>Cloud Firewall</p><p>The Cloud Firewall add-on can block connections to pages and web resources

Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Cloudflare. Cloud Firewall has

Cloudflare IPs by using iptables. This script was made for GNU and Linux
operating systems.

discontinued the project when I heard about the Cloud Firewall add-on.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Tell others about the danger of Cloudflare</p><p>You can ask websites to not use Cloudflare. Please do so in a respectful way.
Mentioning why Cloudflare is not the best option might help. I recommend that
you recommend them an alternative. (Feel free to send me some alternatives,
I want to list some of them on this website)</p><p>You could write an article or share other people their articles with other
people. Make more people aware of this problem.</p><p>Feel free to use the images on my site which are CC0 licensed. CC0 means that

other people. I highly recommend checking it out.</p><p>It is an amazing source of information. The structure of the repository might
make it a bit hard to look through it. Many who read this probably wouldn&rsquo;t

matrix account after writing this article. I don&rsquo;t see it as something
which offers you privacy if it decides to use Cloudflare.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t recommend Matrix because of this problem. Even if it might be
solvable by self-hosting, since you probably will recommend it to
friends. Those friends might decide to use the official Matrix server.
Those friends could be using Cloudflare without knowing the dangers of it.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Fediverse problems</p><p>Avoiding all Cloudflare sites is probably not easy, but I will do what I can.
The content on the Fediverse can be served by Cloudflare, but it only serves
the content of other instances which use Cloudflare through Cloudflare.</p><p>I use the Cloud Firewall add-on and won&rsquo;t whitelist the instance which I use,
which means that I can&rsquo;t see the pictures and some other media when I am using
Mastodon or Pleroma.</p></li></ul><h4 id=i-changed-again-after-a-few-extra-months>I changed again, after a few extra months</h4><ul><li><p>Is privacy worth it?</p><p>I think that productivity matters more than privacy. There are tools which

too much. I do this because I still want to support privacy for the people who
need it.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong privacy is important, but not enough people fight

your code like this and you don&rsquo;t use the <em>&ldquo;cloud&rdquo;</em>. You must be a bad
programmer.</p><figure><img src=../../../images/articles/the-programming-culture-has-problems/old-man-yells-at-cloud.jpg alt="A newspaper with a picture of angry Grampa Simpson who yells at a cloud in the air.

of nonsense about programming.</p><p>The worst part is that there just is no one right way. People make that stuff
up, but you never see any proof. It is something that probably annoys many
people.</p><p>Yes, some things are a bit better as others, but there is no one true way. You
are not superior when you use some new trendy technology. It is probably good
to find the right tool for the job, but the best tool can be something else for
someone else.</p><h4 id=there-is-no-such-thing-as-the-perfect-programming-language>There is no such thing as the perfect programming language</h4><p>People just should teach others how to use a language correctly. There are
different styles and ideas in the programming culture because we are people. We
like different things.</p><p>Facts matter. Some languages are indeed faster or easier for some jobs, but that
does not mean that everyone likes the syntax of that language. Syntax can make a
language more easy to use for some people, so it is something that could matter.</p><p>You might find a programming language the best language, but remember that it is
not the best language for every purpose or everyone.</p><p>People just want to see a tool that works pretty fine in the end. You can
develop it will a language which you enjoy. Think about the product which you
want to make. It might even be great to think about you audience. You might
want to pick another language as C# if you want to make a Free Software tool
for example.</p><p>What are the programming languages which fit your goals? Compare them. It might
be useful to include the difficulty to learn the language as a factor.</p><h4 id=software-quality>Software quality</h4><p>There are a few important factors to reach software quality:</p><ul><li>How good can the programmer(s) program (having a degree doesn&rsquo;t necessarily
mean that you are good at it. I mean that you actually have knowledge,
experience and skill.);</li><li>How much do(es) the programmer(s) know about the project (It is useful to
know something about money if the tool in development is a money management
tool or something);</li><li>How good the programmers work in team (if there is a team).</li><li>How good you are at design patterns. This also depends on what you program.
It might be less needed for some things.</li></ul><h4 id=things-which-bother-me>Things which bother me</h4><ul><li><p>Which methodology should you use?</p><p>A better question might be: <em>Does the methodology really matter?</em></p><p>None of these methodologies tend to be proven. Many of these methodologies
change after a few years. It all sounds like a bunch of nonsense. They might
help a bit, but how essential are they?</p><p>Many great software has been developed without your <em>&ldquo;perfect&rdquo;</em> methodology. I
am not saying that it is bad to follow one. It might help for some people, but
it is not essential and it isn&rsquo;t a strict thing. Some people follow some of
these things to the details, which might waste more time instead of getting
things done.</p><p>A small successful project can even be developed without any methodology. In
fact, there is for example proof which shows that the popular Test Driven
Development method isn&rsquo;t always great.</p><p>Keep in mind that design patterns are something different. I think that most of
those make sense and can make you a better programmer.</p><ul><li><p>Examples of problems with methodologies</p><p><strong>TDD</strong></p><p>Article: <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20150930115748/http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2009/12/29/problems%5Fwith%5Ftdd.html>Problems with TDD - dalke scientific</a></p><p>I know that the mentioned link is old, but it does contain some interesting
text. Testing often helps, but I believe that TDD is not always needed. I agree
that it does not cover every situation.</p><p>There are often some unexpected things which you probably want to have. Take
for example a shopping website with coupons. People can try to add as much
coupons, so that they get things free. This is probably something which you
don&rsquo;t want.</p><p>It is possible that you don&rsquo;t reach a fix for that problem in TDD. Thinking
like a user who tries to cause harm often helps to make your program more
secure. This is not needed in TDD. This is why I think that TDD is not the
only way.</p><p>Extra testing can help. Trying a bunch of things when your
program is finished can help to discover a lot of small problems.
TDD can help, but don&rsquo;t trust methodologies completely. They are
not perfect.</p><p><strong>Agile</strong></p><blockquote><p>" The word “agile” has become sloganized; meaningless at best, jingoist at
worst. We have large swaths of people doing “flaccid agile,” a half-hearted 7
attempt at following a few select software development practices, poorly. We
have scads of vocal agile zealots—as per the definition that a zealot is one
who redoubles their effort after they’ve forgotten their aim. "</p><p>" And worst of all, agile methods themselves have not been agile. Now there‘s
an irony for you.

Following something strict can be great,
but following it too strict can be a problem as well. It can cause fights over
things which might not really matter.</p><p>It is good to have discussions, but try to use good reasons in a discussion.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>New technology is not always better</p><p>For example a simple webpage can ask for a lot of resources nowadays. Those
resources can be used for tracking.</p><p>I am fine if it asks resources for some advanced functionality&mldr; but for
SPYING? <em>Are you serious? Spying?</em></p><p>Many companies still see spying as a good thing, since selling personal data
makes them money. This looks unethical to me.</p><p><strong>There are other ways.</strong><br>You can, for example ask your users for feedback.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Buzzwords</p><p>Buzzwords are everywhere. It isn&rsquo;t really specific to the programming culture.
The thing about buzzwords is that they are usually not needed.</p><p>A funny thing is that many smart people are great at explaining complex things
in simple ways. They also seem to try to avoid buzzwords. The people who use it
on purpose usually do it to look smarter as they are.</p><p>It might be likely that you don&rsquo;t really understand the meaning of a word, if
you use a buzzword.</p><p>We obviously need words to talk, but most buzzwords seem useless, since they
don&rsquo;t have a clear meaning. Use a different word or sentence instead if you can.</p><p>Try to use words which most people understand&mldr; Yeah, I get it buzzwords often
help with marketing an idea or products and we often use them without realizing
it.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>People who spread that a programming job is fun</p><p>Programming as a hobby is fun, but I thought about doing it as a job for a
moment and realized that it is not what it seems. Doing it as a job usually
means that you can&rsquo;t choose what you create.</p><p>This takes away a lot of my motivation or interest in the job. They can limit
what you can learn. A company can say you must use this programming language.
The project can be something that you aren&rsquo;t interested in at all.</p><p>Here is a part of a Dual Core song. I don&rsquo;t want to get in such a situation.
They even mention that the song is made for all the programmers and developers
in the song.</p><blockquote><p>" I know I go and try but my life is broken, pulverized.<br>Work and more and more, there&rsquo;s less time to socialize.<br>And that&rsquo;s just a gamble, so why try and roll the dice?<br>Either in the office or by myself at home, at night.<br>Plus I stopped believing, there&rsquo;s no reason keeping hope alive. "</p><p>&ndash; Dual Core (Unplug - Listen on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDCs4tb-7E" rel="external nofollow">YouTube</a>)</p></blockquote><p>It can be a fun job as well, but it depends on more as one factor. Dare to talk
about the downsides when you say that it is a fun job. It can be fun for some
people, but you have to like the full package.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with programming as a job, but doing it all day on a
project which does not interest me, wouldn&rsquo;t improve my life quality. I wouldn&rsquo;t
enjoy that.</p><ul><li><p>My job ideas for the future</p><p>I find programming nice as a hobby or for own projects, but don&rsquo;t want to do it
as a job. I could try to become a programming teacher or try to learn other
things which interest me.</p><p>I like to have some freedom. I think that something more creative might be
better for me. I should look into 3D-modelling and 2D-animations and stuff. Art
like that can take a lot of time, but the important part is that you enjoy it.
Programming is not a bad job, but I think that it is not for me.</p><p>Money is nice, but happiness is important as well. Your time is limited. I
recommend that you try to use it in a smart way.

productive. You could try to replace less productive relaxing things with more
productive relaxing tasks.</p><p>For example, replace games with watching educational videos or try to learn an
extra skill which you find relaxing. Creating a own website is also something
which you could learn from.</p><p>Games might be useful if you are a game developer and/or seek inspiration, but
they usually do more harm as good for the most people. You could seek info about
the game instead of playing it if you don&rsquo;t want to waste too much time.</p><p>There are debatable execeptions like educational games or playing games for the
art. I don&rsquo;t find most of the popular games that much of an art piece, but some
games are trully wonderful.</p><p>Social media is also a timewaster which you might want to avoid. This isn&rsquo;t the
only reason to avoid it. You can read my <a href=../../../categories/articles/media-and-social-media>Media and social media</a> article for
more information.</p><ul><li><p>Do you can something back for your time?</p><p>Productive activities usually give you something back after a period of time.
Something that you can see as an achievement. Learning something is a task
which returns knowledge. Making a project might even return you donations.
Drawning something might improve your drawning skills, which can also get you
money or respect.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>It is all in the details</p><p>I have to admit that I usually also waste more time as I want to waste. Some
things which you might not think about, might take a lot of time. It is
probably also just healthy to not be too busy.</p><p>Think about the tiny things which you do. Even putting pens which were inside a
closet in a cup on a desk might help. This makes it easier to get the pen when
you need it. You don&rsquo;t have to open the closet and it is easy to pick up.</p></li></ul><h4 id=do-something-productive-every-day>Do something productive every day</h4><p>Big improvements don&rsquo;t always happen in one day. Working hard can help to get
where you want to be. Do something productive every day. This can be something
simple.</p><p>I try to do a small git commit every day. Not every commit looks valuable, but
you improve something a tiny bit. A lot of tiny bits make something big.</p><p>There are exceptions though. You could get sick. It is good to push yourself,
but everyone has a limit. You might need a break when you get sick.</p><h4 id=focus-on-one-task>Focus on one task</h4><p>Many people can work better when they focus on only one thing. Multitasking
often slows you down.</p><p>Multitasking is not always bad. Listening to music while doing something might
increase your productivity depending on the task and music.</p><p>Tiny tasks can usually be multitasked in my experience, but bigger ones can&rsquo;t.
You decide how tiny or big, tiny and big is.</p><h3 id=are-internet-memes-overrated>Are internet memes overrated?</h3><h4 id=what-is-an-internet-meme>What is an internet meme?</h4><p>An internet meme is commonly known as just a meme, which means something else
apparently. An internet meme is an activity, concept, catchphrase, or piece of
media that spreads, often for humorous purposes, from person to person via the
internet.</p><p>That was a bit of text&mldr; you can usually just replace the word internet meme
with internet joke or internet content. The word internet meme is correct, but
the word meme is probably technically incorrect.</p><p>That definition is pretty unclear. A simple avatar or profile picture is an
internet meme, according to that definition. The internet memes that I wrote
about in this article are the common sometimes funny images and short sometimes
funny video formats of the internet memes.</p><h4 id=the-value-of-an-internet-meme>The value of an internet meme</h4><p>An internet meme usually does not have a lot of value in my opinion. The jokes
can be funny for a few minutes. The fun that you get from it usually does not
last long.</p><p>Watching a movie might satisfy you more if you want to have a laugh. Some of
the internet memes are art, but most are just the same repitive jokes with
different text. Some of them aren&rsquo;t even funny in my opinion.</p><h4 id=spam>Spam</h4><p>Many social media contains so many internet memes that it clutters the content
which you might want to see. It can act like spam for the people who don&rsquo;t want
to see that content.</p><p>An internet meme often wastes space for educational or valuable content. Images
can make your content more readable, but internet memes also don&rsquo;t look formal
in my opinion.</p><h4 id=the-internet-meme-culture>The internet meme culture</h4><p>There are different types and sizes of internet memes. Many internet meme
communities claim that the internet memes from 9gag and ifunny are poorly made.</p><p>Internet memes are often poorly made. There are exceptions, but even most of the
famous 4chan memes are often pretty poorly made in my opinion.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t often visit well-known chans or forums. I usually only visit pages or
boards about technology if I do.</p><h4 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h4><p>Internet memes often don&rsquo;t bring a lot of extra value to something. They are
often a waste of space. I might even block them if it becomes possible to do so.</p><p>They can be useful to fill up some content, but be careful if you do that. Your
content might look less formal if you do that.</p><p>The biggest thing that I don&rsquo;t like about memes is that they are overrused and
you download them when you visit a page while you might not even want to see
them.</p><p>I also don&rsquo;t like the word. I will try to use the word internet joke instead. I
am not saying that anyone should ban it, since that probably won&rsquo;t work anyways.
The thing about these jokes is that it is an idea which many people seem to like.</p><h3 id=privacy-focused-software>Privacy focused software</h3><h4 id=what-is-privacy>What is privacy?</h4><figure><img src=../../../images/articles/privacy-focused-software/security-privacy-lock.jpg alt="A man who looks at the white lock which is on the light red background of this image." width=150 height=150></figure><div class=small-font><div></div><p>Security, Privacy, Lock image By Mohamed Hassan - CC0 licensed.</p></div><p>You have a right on privacy.

your name or email. It can include your shopping behavior, the sites which you
visit, medical info, full-time access to your microphone and a lot more.</p><h4 id=why-does-privacy-matter>Why does privacy matter?</h4><ul><li><p>Privacy means caring about others</p><p>Many don&rsquo;t value privacy until they lose it. Caring about other people&rsquo;s
privacy means that you respect them.</p><p>Privacy creates trust. Trust is one of the most important elements of love. In
other words share the love and give your users their privacy.</p><figure><img src=../../../images/articles/privacy-focused-software/heart-printed-padlocks.jpg alt="Two heart-printed stainless steel padlocks." width=200 height=133></figure><div class=small-font><div></div><p>Two heart-printed stainless steel padlocks image By Ylanite Koppens - CC0

the privacy of users. I care about privacy, since I think that others should
have it. It is a right after all.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>I have nothing to hide</p><p>We wouldn&rsquo;t have passwords if no one cared about privacy. In other words, feel
free to make all your logins public if you don&rsquo;t care about privacy. <em>Don&rsquo;t
actually do this. It asks for trouble.</em></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Privacy does not exist</p><p>Some might says that there is no such thing as privacy nowadays. The thing is,
everything is breakable, but you can make it harder. People are less likely to
break something which is not easy to break, since it is easier to break the
thing which is easier to break.</p><p>Time matters, even for the people who attack other people their systems.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>They already have all my data</p><p>Old database data can get removed and you change, so the info which they have
might be irrelevant in the future. There is also a chance that some
cybercriminals remove all that data. The GDPR law (Europe only) is also a thing
now, so you have the right to be forgotten.</p><p>Shouldn&rsquo;t you try to give others their privacy, even if they have your data?
Supporting privacy tools makes them better. It makes life easier for the people
who need privacy.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Not everyone is aware of privacy</p><p>The sad truth is that many companies spy on users, so that they can sell your
personal data to others. Not only companies do this, some cybercriminals also
post personal information which they find online.</p><p>Even your friends might share your personal data without being aware of it.
Privacy usually requires small sacrifices, not everyone has the guts to make
them. Convenience is extremely useful and making every sacrifice is almost,
if not completely impossible.</p><p>Your choices are not everyone&rsquo;s choices. A bit better is already a step in
the right direction. Not everyone has to be an extreme privacy geek.</p></li></ul><h4 id=basic-tips>Basic tips</h4><ul><li><p>Remove things which you no longer use</p><p>This means that attackers have fewer things to attack, which makes the
chance on an attack smaller.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Don&rsquo;t trust everyone</p><p>Avoid websites which you don&rsquo;t trust. Some dangerous websites are very good at
pretending that they are not dangerous. Don&rsquo;t download or trust every random
thing that you read on the internet.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Passwords</p><ul><li>Use a password or any other form of security (PIN, fingerprint,&mldr;) on every
device.</li><li>Use strong passwords and use a different password for every website.</li></ul><p>I highly recommend KeepassXC (GPLv2 licensed) which is a
password database. It generates all your passwords for you.
You only have to remember one password so using it is very
convenient.</p><p>Bitwarden (GPLv3 licensed) is another option if you prefer an online password
database, but remember that online databases can get attacked by other people.
You don&rsquo;t have full-control over this.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Use encryption</p><p>Encryption is another layer of security. It is not bad to make everything a
little bit more secure. I don&rsquo;t use encryption on all my stuff, but I use it
on much stuff. The disadvantage of encryption is that it can make your
system a bit slower.</p><p>You can compare it to using a secret code to talk to someone. The other person
has to know and decode the code to get the result. Encryption is that secret
code.</p><p>Your system will have to do some math before it can access some file,
since the file is not readable without decoding the secret code.</p><blockquote><p>" Number six, any logged clear text, forget it! Encrypt all your data,
take those bytes off the record! "</p><p>&ndash; Dual Core (<a href="https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=Sr8ILq1a%5Fyw&listen=0">0x0A Hack Commandments</a>)</p></blockquote></li></ul><ul><li><p>Decide how far you want to go</p><p>Your online information can be used against you. Know what you post, and know
that people might use it against you.</p><p>Decide how far you are willing to go for privacy. You can make your own choices.
The privacy road is not always convenient. I recommend to at least try to
understand why people care about privacy.</p><p>You might care more when something bad happens with your personal data. I hope
that it does not, but it is better to be prepared.</p></li></ul><h4 id=software-types>Software types</h4><ul><li><p>The most popular types of software</p><p>There are many types of software and knowing a bit about these can learn you
that you should or shouldn&rsquo;t trust something.</p><p>This part of the article is about the different licenses that there are. These
aren&rsquo;t all the licenses. I tried to keep it simple and readable.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Closed source software</p><p>Close source, also know as proprietary software means that no one can read the
code.</p><p>You might think that it helps for privacy, but it is actually the opposite. One
line of code is enough to spy on people. More eyes on the code means that
people find and fix the problems.</p><p>The method of encryption can be known, but those functions are so strong that
most people don&rsquo;t understand it and good methods are not easy to break. Some
methods haven&rsquo;t been broken yet. People who are great at math write those
complex methods.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Open source software</p><p>Open source means that the source, in other words the code is readable for
everyone. This is great, but many open source things also have downsides.</p><p>Open washing is a thing. That means promoting a product like everything is
open, but it actually still contains closed source code. Companies like to do
it.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Public domain software</p><p>Public domain software is open source and has no restrictions, so anyone can
steal the code and sell it. This can be good, but keep in mind that anyone can
steal your code.</p><p>No restrictions means that you can use it for any purpose. It is pretty awesome
to see when a tool uses the public domain license (CC0).</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Free software</p><p>Free or libre software is open source, but it has a different goal as
open source software. The goal is to give the users of the program freedom.</p><p>Keep in mind that many people prefer that you don&rsquo;t call it open source.
The goal is different, and some people find this goal better as
the one which open source has.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t mean free as in gratis. This is a bit confusing some times.
It is free as in freedom. People some times use the word libre to
avoid this confusion. In other words, yes you can ask money for
free software licensed things.</p><p>People can steal your code like public domain software, but only if they
license it as free software.</p><p>Libre software has to respect four freedoms. This can make it a better
option as open source if you care about privacy.</p></li></ul><h4 id=email>Email</h4><ul><li><p>Email providers</p><p>Many mail providers are closed source software which is why you probably should
not trust them. There are not many email providers which are focused on privacy.</p><ul><li>Tutanota (GPLv3 licensed)</li><li>Protonmail (MIT licensed)</li><li>Cock.li - A server which is hosted by one person instead of a company. Use
this at your own risk. Many sites block mailaddresses of this provider.</li><li>Selfhost your email. This is meant for the people who have time and can
afford it. It is definitely not always the easiest route.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Email clients</p><p>There are a lot of clients which I could mention here. I personally just use my
browser to check my email.</p><p>Claws mail, Evolution, Mutt (terminal only),&mldr;</p><p>The reason that I probably would not recommend the popular Mozilla Thunderbird
client is that it is not GPL licensed. I don&rsquo;t think that it uses a bad license,
but there are GPL licensed alternatives.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>PGP</p><p>PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is something which you can use to encrypt your emails.
It works with a web of trust.</p><p>I use Tutanota, so I use the method of encryption which they provide. I don&rsquo;t
often encrypt my emails, but I try to think what I send through email.</p><p>Email is not secure, never send passwords through email.</p></li></ul><h4 id=social-media>Social media</h4><p>It is actually pretty funny that social media is in this list. People can find
a ton of personal information on social media. You could try to stop using the
most social media when you are a privacy fan.</p><p>The most popular social media services are known for not caring about privacy.
Don&rsquo;t put everything publicly on social media, since it is free information for
data mining and cybercriminals. I also recommend removing your old posts.
Information can be used against you.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t trust that something is private on social media. They usually sell your
personal data.</p><ul><li><p>The Fediverse</p><p>The most popular social media network which isn&rsquo;t know for mining your personal
data is probably the Fediverse.</p><p>It can do a lot, including video hosting (like YouTube) and image hosting
(like Instagram). The possibilities of this network are huge.</p><figure class=icon><img src=../../../images/articles/privacy-focused-software/fediverse-logo.png alt="Five nodes in pentagon shape with all diagonals, multicoloured.

You will have to pick
an instance when you want to join it. Don&rsquo;t worry though. You can still talk to
other instances and it is not unusual to switch instance after a few months.</p><p>Some instances use Cloudflare. Cloudflare does not care about your privacy.
I highly recommend to read my <a href=../../../categories/articles/say-no-to-cloudflare>Cloudflare article</a> if you aren&rsquo;t aware of
these problems.</p><ul><li>Similar to Twitter: Mastodon and Pleroma</li><li>Similar to Facebook: Diaspora (Does not use the Fediverse)</li><li>Similar to YouTube: PeerTube</li><li>Similar to Instagram: Pixelfed</li></ul><p>PeerTube does not have as much content as YouTube, but you can
use Invidious if the videos which you like aren&rsquo;t on PeerTube.
Invidious has the same videos as YouTube.</p><p>Keep in mind that the Fediverse still has some problems. The way that it
works is far from perfect.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Chat applications</p><p>IRC and XMPP are probably some of the better ones for privacy.
Keep in mind that public IRC servers usually keep logs.</p><p>Be careful with what you say. Information can be used against you.</p><blockquote><p>" Number three, never trust nobody!
IRC is bad luck when you chat too much. "</p><p>&ndash; Dual Core (<a href="https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=Sr8ILq1a%5Fyw&listen=0">0x0A Hack Commandments</a>)</p></blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t recommend Matrix or Discord. They both use Cloudflare.
Matrix can be selfhosted to solve the problem, but the official
servers use Cloudflare, so you will indirectly tell others to
keep using Cloudflare.</p></li></ul><h4 id=browsers>Browsers</h4><ul><li><p>Support competition</p><p>People compare a lot of browsers, but the privacy problems might be deeper.
I think that there just isn&rsquo;t enough competition.</p><p>Chromium based browsers have a lot of the browser market. I would avoid them.
Support competition instead.</p><p>I do have <a href=../../../projects/Ideas/#idea-better-browser-engine>browser engine idea</a>. Feel free to check it out, if you also think that
the currently browsers lack some privacy features and other features.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Tor browser</p><p>The Tor browser is one of the better privacy focused browsers out there, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t use it for everything. It a bit slow. It isn&rsquo;t perfect either security
wise, but it is better as many of the other options.</p><blockquote><p>" Don&rsquo;t bet your future on just a few tools. Even .onion sites can have leaks
too. "</p><p>&ndash; Dual Core (<a href="https://www.invidio.us/watch?v=Sr8ILq1a%5Fyw&listen=0">0x0A Hack Commandments</a>)</p></blockquote></li></ul><ul><li><p>Abrowser</p><p>I use a browser, no really I use Abrowser. It is like GNU Icecat, but
without the default extensions. The default extensions of GNU Icecat are a bit
too much for me.</p><p>I think that GNU LibreJS will never work in practice unless some law forces
people to license their JavaScript in a GNU LibreJS way. It kinda misses the
point. The idea is not bad, but it just does not work currently.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Firefox and Chromium problems</p><p>Mozilla Firefox uses Cloudflare for DNS, by default unless you use an older
Firefox version. Chromium tracks you a lot, since it is from Google.</p><p>Google also does some great things for the community, but remember that they
are an advertising company. They make the many of their money from their
closed source advertising service, AdWords.</p><p>Tracking users helps them with recommending more personal advertisements,
which might increase the amount of clicks on the ads.</p><p>Mozilla also did some good things for the community. I would pick
Firefox over Chromium if I had to choose. Just know that both browsers
have some privacy problems by defaul</p></li></ul><h4 id=web-browsing-tips>Web browsing tips</h4><ul><li><p>Basic tips</p><p>Many browsers show the location of a link in the left bottom if you place your
mouse on top of the link.</p><p>Some websites have malware on them. Don&rsquo;t trust a site which has a ton of
download buttons or a ton of ads and such. Just use your common sense and check
if the site can be trusted.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Know what the attackers do</p><p>Some people are very good at hiding malware or/and stealing your personal
information. It isn&rsquo;t bad to take a look at the things which cybercriminals
try to do.</p><p>Phishing is a thing that many still fall for. You can easily learn yourself
how to detect many phishing attacks. Phishing is when an attacker sends you an
email or something else which is supposed to look innocent, but it is harmful.</p><p>Defending yourself against attackers is a whole topic, so I suggest that you do
your own research on the basics of defending yourself.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Don&rsquo;t accept cookies</p><p>Cookies are small files which contain a bit of data. This data can be used to
keep your preferences like the language and/or website theme you prefer.</p><p>Those harmless cookies aren&rsquo;t the real problem. The real problems are the
tracking cookies. Those cookies can store your behavior and other personal
browsing data.</p><p>They might contain any of the following information:</p><ul><li>The links you click while using the website</li><li>The amount of time you spend on a website</li><li>The pages which you visit (a bit like your browsing history)</li><li>Much more tracking data</li></ul><p>The Europe GDPR law contains something so that people can&rsquo;t collect personal
data through cookies unless they have your permission. This is one of the
reasons why you might see cookies pop-ups on websites. You can decline cookies
and I recommend you to do so.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Fingerprinting</p><p>It is true that extensions make your browser fingerprint more unique if they
interact with more as the browser UI.</p><p>Every browser has a fingerprint which can be used to track
you. It is not easy to do something about this even the way
in which you type defines a bit of your browser fingerprint.</p><p>Completely getting rid of a unique fingerprint can be impossible.
There is always something which makes it unique unless you use
the defaults of a browser. This is also why the Tor browser is
pretty secure. Many people use it with the default settings.</p><p>You can defend yourself against the most common fingerprinting
techniques. A canvas blocker add-on tries to defend you against
fingerprinting attacks which are caused by the HTML5 canvas element.</p><p>I personally think that add-ons at least protect you from other
dangers, so I think that you should use them. I have a page with
<a href=../../../recommendations/add-ons>add-ons</a> which I recommend.</p></li></ul><h4 id=world-maps>World maps</h4><p>OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a service similar to Google maps.</p><h4 id=search-engines>Search engines</h4><p>Many browsers come with Google as the default search engine,
but keep in mind that Google is an advertising company. They
have to do tracking to make more money.</p><p>Some alternatives are startpage (couldn&rsquo;t find the license) and
searx (AGPL licensed). I switch search engine from time to time.
I have used the above search engines, but it is not easy to pick one.</p><p>YaCy looks like a great option, but I haven&rsquo;t tried it.</p><p>Most search engines are proprietary. Proprietary search engines:
Bing, Qwant, DuckDuckGo (the core of DuckDuckGo is proprietary),&mldr;</p><h4 id=other-recommendations>Other recommendations</h4><ul><li><p>Phones</p><p>Avoid phones or use a ROM like LineageOS and F-Droid as the app
store if you need a phone. This might change in the future, the
Librem 5 might become a good option.</p><p>Only use the features which you need when you decide to use a phone.</p><p>Phones collect a ton of personal info. You are the one that
chooses your sacrifices though. A phone is an important device
for many people.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Operating systems</p><p>Windows and OS X are proprietary, so you shouldn&rsquo;t trust them.
You can use them and many people depend on some specific tools.</p><p>Remember, it is a choice. You probably won&rsquo;t convince someone to
use something if you push them too hard. They can ask you questions
about your system if they are interested.</p><p>The GNU+Linux and BSD operating systems are the alternatives to
those operating systems. I would recommend Debian or Devuan for
beginners. You can try those operating systems in a virtual machine.</p><p>I am not going to lie, these operating systems require some learning,
but it is not that hard.</p><ul><li><p>Other options</p><p>QubesOS looks security focused, but it looks resource heavy.
I also really like what GuixSD is doing.</p><p>You can use a free (as in freedom) distro, but you have to be sure
that you have drivers for everything. I want to recommend this to
everyone, but the privacy sacrifice is too big for most people.</p></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>Keep learning</p><p>Look at the privacy focused movements, and don&rsquo;t trust everything
blindly. Some of these movements are the FSF, the EFF, defective
by design,&mldr;</p><p>I could write more about this, but I wanted to stick to the basics.

the same when they use the word.</p><p>I mean buying things or making decisions based on what
you need instead of what you want with minimalism. It is a state of
mind. This does not mean that you can&rsquo;t have pictures and memories.
You can do it in a extreme way, but you don&rsquo;t have to.</p><p>Minimalism has other advantages as well. You can find things faster,
since you have less stuff to look through. Less stuff means
more money. Less stuff means less garbage.</p><p>Minimalism does not mean that you give up all convenient things.
You can take it that far, but you don&rsquo;t have to.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Take care of your stuff</p><p>Your stuff should last longer when you are more careful with it.

about</strong></p><h4 id=the-gpl-attempts-to-force-people-to-release-their-source-code>The GPL attempts to force people to release their source code</h4><p>It would be great if this would actually work.</p><p>Think about it for a minute. What would a closed source company do?</p><p>They would use the code and not tell anybody or in the other case write code
from scratch. I don&rsquo;t think that that first option would benefit anyone. The
code would stay secret and improvements will not help the project.</p><p>Consider the same project under another license like MIT or BSD. The company
might use the code, but they are more likely to commit changes back. This can
lead to a better project.</p><h4 id=the-gpl-license-isn-t-easy-to-understand>The GPL license isn’t easy to understand</h4><p>The GPL is complex. You are supposed to include a license notice on every file
for example. That takes some effort. You can find many incorrectly GPL licensed
projects online.</p><h4 id=you-have-to-re-release-programs-under-the-gpl-license>You have to re-release programs under the GPL license</h4><p>The GPL forces you to release anything which uses the source code of the
program under the GPL license. This means that closed source companies can’t
build a closed source version or new program based on your GPL licensed
software.</p><h4 id=my-opinion-about-the-gpl>My opinion about the GPL</h4><p>I think that people who use the GPL usually have good intentions. I do like,
use and trust many GPL licensed software.</p><p>I believe that you shouldn’t trust licenses. Look at what others think of the
software and check the history of the software. The GPL license makes a program
more trustable, but it is still a license. Licenses can be violated. The idea
of the GPL is not bad, but it is different in practice.</p><p>I do prefer programs which have readable code because people can read the code
and make it better. Closed source can be bad, but you never trully know.</p><p><br></p><p>What if they never do anything bad with the code or your personal data?</p><p>Does your online privacy even matter? You can find more about this in my
<a href=../../../categories/articles/how-important-is-online-privacy>How important is online privacy?</a> article.</p><h4 id=which-licenses-should-you-use>Which licenses should you use?</h4><p>That totally depends. I don’t think that the GPL is bad. It just requires some
effort to implement. I think that it is great for privacy and trust. The GPL
can be a good choice, but please think before you use it.</p><p>I think that BSD, MIT, CC0,&mldr; are better licenses if you want to be good for
people. Keep in mind that everything can have a bad side. CC0 also know as
public domain means that anyone can steal your program. It has no restrictions.</p><p>You should do some research on the different licenses before you pick one. Make
sure to think enough about it. Licenses can have consequences.</p><h3 id=how-important-is-online-privacy>How important is online privacy?</h3><h4 id=does-privacy-matter>Does privacy matter?</h4><p>Yes, privacy matters for <a href=../../../categories/articles/privacy-focused-software>some reasons</a>, but how much should we care?</p><h4 id=what-is-the-most-important-thing-about-privacy>What is the most important thing about privacy</h4><p>The most important thing about online privacy is probably security. The
problem is that it often hurts convenience. It is often just not worth
it and you can&rsquo;t always fight against it.</p><p><a href=../../../categories/articles/say-no-to-cloudflare/>Cloudflare</a> for example, is hard to fight against. I don&rsquo;t think that it
is worth it. I used to care a ton about privacy, until I started thinking
about the time it takes. You almost have to use unethical things like
Cloudflare, so many things depend on it.</p><p>It feels like online privacy does not exist. Keep in mind that security
does exist. You don&rsquo;t want to give your passwords to attackers.</p><p>You can&rsquo;t fight against everything without missing out on important
things. Phones save every move you make. Websearch &ldquo;Snowden phones&rdquo;
if you don&rsquo;t believe me. Google and other big companies also play with
your personal data.</p><h4 id=seek-balance>Seek balance</h4><p>Make hard for the attackers, but not too hard. Not too hard still means
that your security should be better than average.</p><p>There are enough people who are less secure as you. Attackers will pick
those victims unless you are a very important person.</p><p>Fighting for privacy often takes away a lot of your convenience. You
might be more productive without caring about all those things. I think
that you should often pick productivity over security.</p><p>This does not mean that is ethical to take away the privacy of others.
I find that a nasty and unjust move. I respect people who fight for
privacy and I believe that everyone needs privacy.</p><p>It is just sad that so many things are being controlled. I hope that
GNUnet fixes some of the damage that has been done to the internet.</p><h4 id=are-there-any-good-security-related-tools>Are there any good security related tools?</h4><p>I do recommend things like password databases, just because it makes your life
even more convenient and more secure. It is worth it. It is ok to choose
security sometimes, but don&rsquo;t let it ruin your life.</p><p>It is not bad to know how you can protect yourself, but also ask yourself of
it is worth it. Security and privacy matters, but so does convenience and
productivity.</p><p>One basic rule is think before you post something on the internet. This alone,
can help you a lot. People can use your data against you.</p><h4 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h4><p>Choose how far you are willing to go, but don&rsquo;t become too obsessed with it.
Security and privacy matters, but so does convenience and productivity.</p><h3 id=you-should-use-keepass>You should use KeePass</h3><h4 id=why-keepass>Why KeePass?</h4><figure class=icon><img src=../../../images/articles/you-should-use-keepass/keepassxc-logo.png alt="The KeePassXC logo." width=240 height=240></figure><div class=small-font><div></div><p>KeePassXC - CC0 licensed.</p></div><ul><li><p>Convenience</p><p>KeePass is a offline password database.

a GNU challenge as a Linux one. There weren&rsquo;t any question about the Linux
kernel.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think that anyone has the possibility to know everything about the
Linux kernel or all the GNU utils.</p><p>The finals were in Belgium, so it was mainly meant for people from Belgium, but
other people could participate as well.</p><p>I wanted to give this a try, since I use GNU+Linux system. I use it daily,
but this does not necessarily mean that I really know GNU or Linux.</p><figure><img src=../../../images/articles/linux-challenge/linux-challenge-student-winners.jpg alt="The student winners of the Linux Challenge 2019 standing next to each other." width=400 height=210></figure><div class=small-font><div></div><p>The student winners of the Linux Challenge 2019 standing next to each other - I
couldn&rsquo;t find the license, but I am pretty sure that I can use this.</p></div><p>I am the person on the right, with the beard. I finished second of all the
students.</p><h4 id=the-questions>The questions</h4><p>The questions were pretty doable in my opinion, but I am not going to say that
luck isn&rsquo;t a factor. They mentioned that the scores were pretty high in general,
so the ones who did not win should be proud as well.</p><p>Most questions went pretty smoothly, but not all did. I found the way in which
the challenge was done, pretty good and comfortable.</p><h4 id=some-feelings>Some feelings</h4><p>I felt a bit out of my comfort zone when they mentioned my name, since I did
not expect it. I am an introvert and was not very social or talkative during the
event. My dad drove me to the event and was also watching, which did not really
help either. I appreciate the support though.</p><p>I can only blame me for not talking much. It is something that I want to work
on. I am probably not the most asocial introvert, but being asocial happens
from time to time.</p><h4 id=red-hat-talk-about-containers>Red Hat talk about containers</h4><p>There also was a talk from Red Hat about containers. That talk was pretty
interesting. It was a good experience overall. It made me think that containers
could be a solution. I changed my mind after some research.</p><p>There are other ways, which are even better. Some people think that containers
provide more security from hackers, but this is simply not true and managing
containers takes time.</p><p>The approach of the Guix package manager looks very great. This wasn&rsquo;t
mentioned in the talk. The Guix package manager fixes many of the current
container problems. Containers are usually not reproducable, which is not great
for people who care about privacy and security. Guix packs are reproducable.</p><p>GuixSD can even reproduce itself (the current whole system) as a live USB, in a
VM or other things. In other words it is very cool.</p><h4 id=isn-t-this-event-closed-source>Isn&rsquo;t this event closed source?</h4><p>It probably is in some way, but you have to make some decisions. I support free
software, but some privacy sacrifices might be worth it.</p><ul><li><p>Different opinions</p><p>I am not someone who complains about words which I don&rsquo;t agree with. I try to
see why others have a different opinion, so that I can learn from that.</p><p>I completely understand why people use the word &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;GNU+Linux&rdquo;
or other words. Linux is just an easier word to market and people know the word.
This does not mean that I agree with the word. The GNU project deserves credit
in my opinion.</p><p>My opinion about the naming problem: <a href=../../../about/the-gnu-linux-system-naming-problem/>The GNU Linux system naming problem</a></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Is everyone an hypocrite?</p><p>Everyone probably depends on some closed source stuff (even if it are just some
protocols or bank card stuff). Everyone probably also depends on free software.
Everyone is probably a hypocrite.</p><blockquote><p>" All solutions are hacks. Every opposite is an equal (and if it attracts, look
out or you&rsquo;ll make a sequel). Freedom&rsquo;s a right but having any means you&rsquo;re
privileged. And our religion of consumerism might have hit a glitch. Clowns are
unhappy. Jugglers drop stuff. I display cowardice whenever you talk tough. My
least favorite thing is a hypocrite, but I&rsquo;ll be one. "</p><p>&ndash; MC Frontalot (Front The Least)</p></blockquote></li></ul><h4 id=thanks-to-dot-dot-dot>Thanks to&mldr;</h4><p>I would like to thank a friend who told me about this event. I wouldn&rsquo;t have
heard about this event if it wasn&rsquo;t for her. That said, I felt like I owned
her a drink so I bought her one.</p><p>I obviously also should thank the college, which I go to and the organisators
of the event. The college that I go to is called Hogeschool PXL and the
organisators of this event were EDITx and FPS Finance.</p><h3 id=fosdem-2020>FOSDEM 2020</h3><h4 id=what-is-fosdem>What is FOSDEM?</h4><figure class=icon><img src=../../../images/articles/fosdem/fosdem.png alt="The logo of FOSDEM a big purple gear with the text FOSDEM in the middle of it." width=149 height=150></figure><div class=small-font><div></div><p>Copyright © FOSDEM - CC BY 2.0 BE licensed.<br>Changes: compressed the image and changed the size of the image.</p></div><p>FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and
collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source
software from all over the world gather at the event in Belgium in Brussels.</p><h4 id=my-experience-at-fosdem>My experience at FOSDEM</h4><p>FOSDEM was great, just like <a href=../../../articles/fosdem-2019>last year</a>.</p><p>There were a lot of interesting talks.
I actually met someone from the Fediverse this year. We missed out
on meeting an other person who uses the Fediverse, because we
just couldn&rsquo;t find each other. Hey, at least I met someone which is cool.</p><p>I met OTheB at FOSDEM. He is developing his own programming language. We
had some nice talks.</p><div class=link-list><div></div><p><a href=https://boxin.space rel=external>Website</a></p></div><div class=link-list><div></div><p><a href=https://mastodon.technology/@OTheB rel="external nofollow">Mastodon</a></p></div><p>I didn&rsquo;t talk to many of the stands this year. We saw many talks though.
You can&rsquo;t do everything.</p><p>I enjoyed it and would go again. I am not saying that it is for everyone,
since it is about free and open software and that might be a bit too
nerdy/geeky for some people.</p><h4 id=projects-that-i-had-not-heard-of>Projects that I had not heard of</h4><ul><li><p>Sourcehut</p><p>Sourcehut is a platform for Git, like Gitlab and Github. The cool thing
about Sourcehut is that people don&rsquo;t have to create an account to
contribute to projects. It also uses bash scripts, so you can easily
make some kind of pipeline.</p><p>It looks very promising. Honestly, it is possible that Github or Gitlab uses
the same idea some day.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>KDE Itinerary</p><p>KDE Itinerary is a digital traveling assistant focused on protecting your
privacy. I think that it is not fully free (as in freedom), but it surely
looks great. You no longer need the google API to travel.</p><p>I really recommend to check this one out.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>MuseScore</p><p>MuseScore is a free and open-source program to create, play and print
music sheets. The fun part was when I got home and my sister (who
plays violin) said that she knew it and actually used it.</p></li></ul><h4 id=other-projects>Other projects</h4><ul><li><p>GNU/Linux phones</p><p>The KDE and Pine stands were always packed with people. Those stands had the
new GNU/Linux phones. There were some interesting talks about the phones as
well.</p><p>I personally am going to wait until more phones have been released. OTheB
ordered the Librem5 when they asked for donations. It is cool that these
things exist now. I really look forward to getting one, when the time is
right.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Haiku</p><p>Haiku is an free and open-source operating system based on BeOS. BeOS is
an OS from 1995. They had gratis disks with Haiku on it. I managed to get
one and installed it on my previous laptop.</p><p>It really feels like a system from a few years ago. I am not sure what I am
going to use it for. It is different than many operating systems, and that
is cool in a way. I hope that some software runs on it.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>GNUnet</p><p>We managed to catch a talk about GNUnet. GNUnet is a new more secure
implementation for the internet. It replaces every layer in the OSI model.</p><p>It was pretty technical, but it was worth it. Some layers of GNUnet are
ready to use. They are talking to many other organizations and already have
standardized some parts of the new model. GNS which will replace DNS has
been through that process already.</p><p>Keep in mind that it will take a few years before you can use it in
production environments.</p><p>Another cool thing is that GNUnet, written in C, can be extended on. It
can be done in different languages. So you can basically replace a part
in the model with your own code.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Matrix</p><p>I have been negative about Matrix before in my Cloudflare article, but lets
look at reality. It is getting more popular and is a solution for connecting
different messaging systems. I still don&rsquo;t want to use it, but they are
doing something cool. I rather avoid Cloudflare on things which I use often.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Even more projects</p><p>There were too many projects to mention them all. Nextcloud, Gitlab, Godot
and many other unmentioned projects were also there. Most projects at FOSDEM
are awesome, so don&rsquo;t think that this list contains all the awesome projects.</p></li></ul><h3 id=fosdem-2019>FOSDEM 2019</h3><h4 id=what-is-fosdem>What is FOSDEM?</h4><figure class=icon><img src=../../../images/articles/fosdem/fosdem.png alt="The logo of FOSDEM a big purple gear with the text FOSDEM in the middle of it." width=149 height=150></figure><div class=small-font><div></div><p>Copyright © FOSDEM - CC BY 2.0 BE licensed.<br>Changes: compressed the image and changed the size of the image.</p></div><p>FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and
collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source
software from all over the world gather at the event in Belgium in Brussels.</p><h4 id=my-experience-at-fosdem>My experience at FOSDEM</h4><p>FOSDEM was a great experience. There were a lot of interesting talks. I didn&rsquo;t
really socialize with many people, but I talked to some of the stands. I was
mainly there for the talks, which were interesting, but it might be better to
go for meeting people. It is personal preference.</p><p>I am not saying that it is for everyone, since it is about free and open
software and that might be a bit too nerdy/geeky for some people.</p><h4 id=projects-that-i-had-not-heard-of>Projects that I had not heard of</h4><ul><li><p>Open Source Design</p><p>A community of designers and developers pushing more open design processes and
improving the user experience and interface design of open source software.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Apache Beam</p><p>Apache Beam is an advanced unified programming model. You can choose your
language and your runtime with Apache Beam. It is not the easiest thing to
explain but it seems useful.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>The illumos projects</p><p>I had no idea that solaris based OS&rsquo;s were still around. It is probably
something that many people know about, but I didn&rsquo;t.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Google Summer of Code</p><p>You probably didn&rsquo;t expect Google to be on this list, but I like the idea behind
this. Summer of Code is something for students that is supposed to give
students an open source project.</p><p>I think that it is a competition, but I am not sure. The cool thing is that it
is all about open source. I haven&rsquo;t checked of it also allows free software
projects, but I think that it does. Open source is a great start though.</p></li></ul><h4 id=other-interesting-projects>Other interesting projects</h4><ul><li><p>GuixSD</p><p>GuixSD is an advanced distribution which respects the freedom of computer users.
This distribution is almost completely written in GNU Guile. This is a distro
that I really want to run. It is just so cool.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>LibreOffice</p><p>LibreOffice is a powerful free (as in freedom) office suite. They were looking
for contributors and LibreOffice is a cool project in general.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>FSFE</p><p>You know that I had to talk to the Free Software Foundation Europe people,
since I am a free software enthusiast. Belgium did not have a local group yet,
but that can change. I was not the only one who talked about that apparently.</p><p><em>Hey, it is me from the future!:</em> I formed an unofficial local group with
people. It might become official some day. Please contact me if you are
interested. The FSFE is aware of this. I might write an article about the group
some day.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Librem 5</p><p>A project by Purism (which is a pretty cool company). The Librem 5 is supposed
to become the first free (as in freedom) phone.</p><p>I am not sure of it will be that free (as in freedom) when I listened to the
answers of some people their questions. They also seemed to still have a few
problems. I really want this project to succeed, but I am not sure of it will.</p><p>It is a great start for new projects. I find it a wonderful project. Many
people would like to see something like this in free software.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Even more projects</p><p>There were too many projects to mention them all. Nextcloud, Gitlab, Ceph and
many other unmentioned projects were also there. Most projects at FOSDEM are
awesome, so don&rsquo;t think that this list contains all the awesome projects.</p></li></ul><h3 id=day-against-drm>Day Against DRM</h3><h4 id=what-is-drm>What is DRM?</h4><figure><img src=../../../images/articles/international-day-against-drm/eliminate-drm.jpg alt="The eliminate DRM logo. The text on the logo is 'ELIMINATE DRM DefectiveByDesign.org'." width=260 height=162></figure><p>DRM means Digital Right Management, but some opponents of DRM prefer to call
it Digital Restrictions Management.</p><p>It is a method to prevent the customer from doing certain things like making
copies. DRM is a tool that restricts the user from doing certain things. DRM
is about restrictions, not rights.</p><h4 id=day-against-drm-2019>Day against DRM 2019</h4><p>Day against DRM focused on ebooks during 2019.</p><p>Microsoft deleted thousands of ebooks from ebook readers, smartphones and
other devices.</p><p>Students had DRM on some textbooks in schools. Some students couldn&rsquo;t access
these textbooks because of the DRM on the textbooks. Everyone has the right
on education, so why do people use DRM, which prevents many people from
reading textbooks?</p><p>There are <a href=https://www.defectivebydesign.org/dayagainstdrm/2019/dust-jacket rel=external>dust jackets</a> available to print out and wrap around books. Please
spread the word.</p><h4 id=why-is-it-bad>Why is it bad?</h4><ul><li><p>It encourages piracy</p><p>It fails to prevent people to illegally pirate the product. Many users who
pirate a product don&rsquo;t seem to have problems with DRM, since people can remove
the DRM. It is probably illegal to remove it, but pirating is illegal as well.</p><p>The legal consumers who purchase a product seem to have the problems. This
seems to encourage piracy, but it was probably made to prevent it.</p><p><em>Do companies really believe that DRM is good for the marketshare of the
product?</em></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>You can lose your product</p><p>It is possible that you can lose a product, which you paid for. It has happened
before and people don&rsquo;t always get their money back.</p><p>Many products which use DRM can&rsquo;t be accessed without internet. This means that
you lose the product when the servers go offline or when people decide to remove
the product from the server.</p><p>I repeat: <em>Do companies really believe that DRM is good for the marketshare of
the product?</em></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>It can prevent people from using it</p><p>DRM capabilities on PDFs allow the maker of for example a PDF to block the
ability to use a screen reader with it. This prevents blind people from making
use of that content.</p><p>I repeat again: <em>Do companies really believe that DRM is good for the
marketshare of the product?</em></p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Some other reasons</p><ul><li>DRM can track you;</li><li>DRM also often hurts the performance of your product;</li><li><strong>DRM is simply bad for the consumers.</strong></li></ul></li></ul><h4 id=my-experience-with-drm>My experience with DRM</h4><p>I use a windows 10 KVM for college purposes. The steam trap caught me before I
knew about DRM and free software. I will probably leave steam some day.</p><p>The steam alternative that I recommend is <a href=https://www.gog.com rel="external nofollow">GOG</a>. GOG is DRM-free. The struggle of
not being able to play some games without internet is not the nicest thing to
experience.</p><p>I do not play a lot of games nowadays, since I have other things to do. Time is
limited, so I prefer to work on projects instead of playing games.</p><h4 id=how-can-you-help>How can you help?</h4><p>There are many ways to fight against DRM. Defective by design has a
<a href=https://www.defectivebydesign.org/dayagainstdrm rel="external nofollow">campaign against DRM</a> every year. Their site also contains more ways to protest
against DRM.</p><h3 id=i-met-ryako-at-a-musical>I met Ryako at a musical</h3><h4 id=how-i-heard-about-ryako>How I heard about Ryako</h4><p>Twill Distilled from Wreck The System was chatting with me and asked if I had
heard about Ryako. I did not at the time, but I looked her up right after I
heard about her.</p><p>The funny thing is that she joined the chat room when we chatted about how cool
some of her songs are. Much thanks to Twill to tell me about Ryako.</p><figure><img src=../../../images/articles/i-met-ryako-at-a-musical/twill-distilled.jpg alt="Picture of Twill Distilled." width=281 height=226></figure><div class=small-font><div></div><p>Twill Distilled - CC0 licensed.</p></div><p>Twill Distilled:</p><div class=link-list><div></div><p><a href=https://twilldistilled.com title="Twill Distilled's website" rel="external nofollow">Website</a>

me about a musical which she participated in. I went to the event.</p><figure><img src=../../../images/articles/i-met-ryako-at-a-musical/ryako.jpg alt="Picture of Ryako." width=300 height=200></figure><div class=small-font><div></div><p>Ryako - CC0 licensed.</p></div><h4 id=brussels-light-opera-company>Brussels Light Opera Company</h4><p>The event itself was enjoyable. I had never been to a musical before. I had,
however, seen &ldquo;Little Shop of Horrors&rdquo; which is a musical. I highly recommend
it and Ryako also likes it.</p><p>The costume designs were neat and the actors performed well in my opinion.
The Chorus was great as well. I enjoyed it and was not disappointed.</p><p>The play was &ldquo;Kiss Me, Kate&rdquo; written by Samuel and Bella Spewack with music and
lyrics by Cole Porter. A musical adaptation of Shakespeare’s
&ldquo;A Taming of the Shrew&rdquo; directed by Fred Graham.</p><h4 id=talking-with-ryako>Talking with Ryako</h4><p>Ryako did not have much time, but she was very kind. She gave me a bag with
merch, gave me a hug and we had a chat.</p><p>She gave me a lot of merch (including a T-shirt which is not in the picture
since I was wearing it). I expected to get nothing, but I got so much. She was
able to do so much in such a small time.</p><figure><img src=../../../images/articles/i-met-ryako-at-a-musical/merch.jpg alt="Picture of the merch which I got from Ryako." width=300 height=195></figure><div class=small-font><div></div><p>Picture of the merch, which I got from Ryako, which is laying on my

exhausted. She also was busy with the Nerdcore VPC which you might know. I
believe that she will make it in the genre. Her voice is great.</p><p>She will have more time for music now that the event has passed. I wasn&rsquo;t able
to ask a lot of questions because of the time. She also likes Twin Peaks which
is awesome.</p><h4 id=more-about-ryako>More about Ryako</h4><p>I find her website well designed. I usually don&rsquo;t like all caps, but it fits
the design. It also contains a text game if you look good enough.</p><p>She blogs from time to time. It is a nice thing to read if you like her.</p><p>You can find Ryako here:</p><div class=link-list><div></div><p><a href=https://www.ryakomusic.com title="Ryako's website" rel=external>Website</a>

dwm configuration. The package will provide you the dwmconf
command. This command will have some parameters which will
help you with configuring dwm.</p><p>You can also think about this project for another program.
This came to my mind, since many packages of the suckless
project aren&rsquo;t that user friendly to install. This can make
one of their packages more user friendly to configure.</p><h4 id=useful-wiki>useful-wiki</h4><p>The purpose of this project is to help people with finding
the right wiki&rsquo;s quickly.</p><h4 id=cloud-firewall>Cloud Firewall</h4><p>You might have heard of the Cloud Firewall browser extension.
The idea is to make the same thing, but as a actual application
which runs on your desktop. Firewall blocking by using the Firewall
of the system should work better than an add-on which does it by rDNS
requests.</p><h4 id=better-browser-engine>Better browser engine</h4><p>A browser engine is the core of every web browser.
It is the part of the browser which renders your pages.</p><p>The idea is to create a browser engine with editable options.
These options should make it possible to create different configurations.</p><p>Some configurations could focus on privacy
while others could focus on a browser with many features
for average users.</p><ul><li><p>Why?</p><p>The browser engine market is rather small,
but I hear many people complaining that they
can&rsquo;t do some things in their browser.</p><p>Some wanted features are:</p><ul><li>Keybindings (Vi and GNU Emacs ones for example)</li><li>Better control over security settings</li><li>Default external link configuration (configuration options
could be: new tab, new window or default)</li><li>&mldr;</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><p>How can you achieve extendibility?</p><p>I was thinking of doing this by creating different packages.
The basic browser engine should already contain some by
default though. A bit like how repositories work.
The system which GNU Emacs uses as well.</p></li></ul><h4 id=modern-new-editor>Modern new editor</h4><p>GNU Emacs does not use code parsers to do the syntax highlighting or
at least not by default. The way that it does syntax highlighting is
by regular expressions. This can cause incorrect syntax highlighting.</p><p>Vi-like things are even worse, since they can&rsquo;t even handle multiple
language syntax highlighting in one file.</p><p>I find the way in which GNU Emacs handles packages great,
but the editor is becoming more outdated. It works with repositories.
The defaults of GNU Emacs aren&rsquo;t great either. I think that parsers
or not should be a choice.</p><p>I would like keybindings like Xah Lee has, since he has invested a lot of
time in keyboards. Vi and Emacs keybindings are not good when it comes to
working for a long time. I do think that keybindings should be a thing which
is easily changable.</p><p>I do want a configurable config, just like the GNU Emacs one. It should
be lightweight and easy to install. I do want it to be a tiny bit more modern.
Some packages could be a bit more heavy, but lightweight alternatives should
exist.</p><h3 id=projects-which-i-helped-with>Projects which I helped with</h3><h4 id=bunny>bunny</h4><p>A simple shell script wrapper around multiple package managers.</p><p>I implemented guix support in bunny and helped with the bunny website.</p><div class=link-list><div></div><p><a href=https://bunny-team.gitlab.io rel="external nofollow">Website</a>
