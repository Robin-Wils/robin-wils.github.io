<a href=#the-bad-batch-movie--2016>The Bad Batch</a></div><h3 id=firefly-series-and-serenity-movie>Firefly series and Serenity movie</h3><p>Sci-Fi, Drama serie. It is probably the best Sci-Fi thing I saw.
I can&rsquo;t recommend this enough. The series follows a spaceship called
Serenity.</p><p>The Serenity movie is great as well.</p><h3 id=ex-machina-movie>Ex Machina movie</h3><p>Sci-Fi thriller movie about a programmer who gets selected to participate
in an experiment to test a highly advanced humanoid android.</p><h3 id=serial-experiments-lain-anime-series>Serial Experiments Lain anime series</h3><p>This series follow a middle school girl and her introduction to the
wired, something similar to the Internet.</p><p>It is a wonderful, cyberpunk, psychological anime. I love it.
The music is great too. I can&rsquo;t recommend this enough.</p><h3 id=short-circuit-movies>Short Circuit movies</h3><p>Comedy, Sci-Fi movies about a military robot which gains a humanlike
intelligence, which it wants to explore.</p><h3 id=blade-runner-2049-movie--2017>Blade Runner 2049 movie (2017)</h3><p>A sequel to the 1982 Blade Runner movie.</p><p>I liked this movie, but I did not like Blade Runner: The Final Cut. This
one was alright, even though it had much action. It was interesting.</p><p>Very cyberpunk styled movie.</p><h3 id=star-trek-series-and-movies>Star Trek series and movies</h3><p>I never really liked Star Wars it was too much action for me.
Sure it is well-made, but I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it.</p><p>Star Trek focuses more on the characters in a spaceship, less on
action and fighting.</p><p>There is fighting in Star Trek, but it isn&rsquo;t about fighting. It is
about maintaining the peace. I like it.</p><h4 id=the-original-series>The Original Series</h4><p>I loved the original series. It was funny and interesting.
My favorite captian, so far is the original one, captain Kirk.</p><p>I also love the characters which don&rsquo;t get that much screen time like
Sulu. I really liked his acting.</p><p>The first episode was also so great. I didn&rsquo;t expect to like Star Trek,
but I was enjoying it. It was a pretty clever episode, or at least more
clever than I expected.</p><h4 id=the-next-generation>The Next Generation</h4><p>I liked the original series more, but this was entertaining too. It is
cool that it managed to be alright.</p><p>People usually don&rsquo;t like change, so I think that &ldquo;The Next Generation&rdquo;
did a fantastic job.</p><p>The new Characters and parts of the ship are pretty cool. I do like the
Characters of the original Star Trek more though. They are just a bit
more funny, less serious.</p><h4 id=deep-space-nine>Deep Space Nine</h4><p>I haven&rsquo;t seen this yet.</p><h4 id=star-trek-iv-the-voyage-home>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</h4><p>The only movie from Star Trek which I really liked. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong
though. Some of the other movies were alright too.</p><p>The first one was not that enjoyable to me and anything after
Star Trek: Nemesis didn&rsquo;t do it for me, but I watched it completely.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t like Nemesis. Too much shooting, it feels more like how I
remember Star Wars (much action).</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t watch the movies after 2009. Star Trek ﻿2009 really didn&rsquo;t
do it for me. I even turned it off and didn&rsquo;t watch it completely.</p><h3 id=ergo-proxy-anime-series>Ergo Proxy anime series</h3><p>Great cyberpunk anime. It was very enjoyable, but Serial Experiments
Lain is my favorite.</p><p>The story follows Re-l who is assigned to investigate some murders with
her android partner Iggy.</p><h3 id=a-space-odyssey-movies>A Space Odyssey movies</h3><p>Overall a great movie. Not everyone likes the ending though.
I really love the style of the movie and the ending too.</p><p>It is a beautiful movie about space.
I haven&rsquo;t seen 2010 yet, which is the sequel.</p><h3 id=wargames--1983>Wargames (1983)</h3><p>A young kid connects to a secret computer which is much more important
than he things.</p><p>It is a movie for computernerds in some ways though.</p><h3 id=doctor-who-series>Doctor Who series</h3><p>Pretty interesting series. I haven&rsquo;t seen all episodes though.
It is good for a few seasons, but so many seasons exist. It manages
to stay somewhat interesting.</p><p>It is about a Time Lord called the Doctor who travels through time
and space in a blue police box (public telephone kiosk), called the
TARDIS. It a ship, not an actual police box.</p><p>I would recommend it, but also make time for other series and movies.</p><h3 id=the-matrix-movies>The Matrix movies</h3><p>I loved the first movie, but the second movie was too much action focused.
The second movie wasn&rsquo;t that bad though. It is a pretty cool movie.</p><p>Cyberpunk themed movie with a great story.</p><h3 id=back-to-the-future-movies>Back to the Future movies</h3><p>It is about a scientist and and teenager who travel back in time.
These movies were enjoyable and pretty cool.</p><h3 id=the-bad-batch-movie--2016>The Bad Batch movie (2016)</h3><p>Sci-Fi thriller movie. I did like this movie, but it wasn&rsquo;t perfect.
It has some cyberpunk elements though. It is a bit slow, but it was
alright.</p><p>The reviews aren&rsquo;t that great, but the movie was alright in my opinion.</p><h2 id=comedy-series-and-movies>Comedy series and movies</h2><div class=link-list><div></div><a href=#monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-movie>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a>

very great, but the Holy Grail is a masterpiece.</p><p>It is about King Arthur who searches for men to join the Knights of the
Round Table. He isn&rsquo;t your regular knight, but you will notice that soon
enough.</p><p>Monty Python&rsquo;s The Meaning of Life wasn&rsquo;t that great in my opinion,

pretty sure that it was a good one. I remember something about bowling.
It is a crime comedy.</p><p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have it in this list before rewatching it actually.
It is possible that I don&rsquo;t actually like it.</p><h3 id=seinfeld-series>Seinfeld series</h3><p>Your typical comedy sitcom, a show about nothing. The characters are
pretty great though. It is worth a watch.</p><h3 id=the-it-crowd-series>The IT Crowd series</h3><p>A comedy series about a tech department with some geeks. It is pretty funny.</p><h3 id=ash-vs-evil-dead-series>Ash vs Evil Dead series</h3><p>The Evil Dead (horror) movies are not bad, but I liked Braindead a ton
more. The Evil Dead movies are worth watching though.</p><p>The series (comedy horror) are great. Ash played by Bruce Campbell is
amazing. Be warned though, some episodes are worse than the others. I
didn&rsquo;t like the first episode a lot.</p><h3 id=deadpool-movies>Deadpool movies</h3><p>I usually don&rsquo;t like superhero movies, but deadpool is a bit different.
It&rsquo;s a comedy.</p><p>Watch or download <a href=https://archive.org/details/Deadpool.2016.1080pDualLat%5F201805 rel="external nofollow">Deadpool</a> for free (archive.org)</p><h3 id=shaun-of-the-dead-movie>Shaun of the Dead movie</h3><p>Horror comedy movie about zombies. It is a pretty good movie.</p><h3 id=scary-movie-movies>Scary Movie movies</h3><p>Comedy movies which parodies many horror movies.
The first movie was pretty good, the second one was ok too, but the
third one wasn&rsquo;t that funny anymore.</p><p>The fourth and fifth ones were not great in general. Honestly Scary
Movie is overrated in my opinion.</p><h3 id=rick-and-morty-animated-series>Rick and Morty animated series</h3><p>Do I really need to say more? I have the big IQ because of this series.
Ok, it is a Sci-Fi comedy about a scientist, Rick and his grandson Morty.</p><p>It is a parody on Back to the Future.</p><h2 id=horror-movies>Horror movies</h2><div class=link-list><div></div><a href=#braindead--also-known-as-dead-alive>Braindead</a>

is a pretty spooky movie.</p><p>I guess that the skies are dark. I can&rsquo;t say much about this movies
without spoiling too much.</p><h3 id=we-are-what-we-are--2013>We Are What We Are (2013)</h3><p>This horror movie was great, but probably because I watched it without
knowing anything about it. I highly recommend doing the same, reading
about the movie would ruin it.</p><p>It is a remake of a Mexican movie with the same name. The original
might be better. It has a lower rating though. I haven&rsquo;t seen the
original.</p><h3 id=alien--1979>Alien (1979)</h3><p>The original Alien has a good atmosphere. I think that it is a great
movie. It is about a spaceship which is on a return trip to Earth.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t like the movies which I saw from Aliens vs Predator
though. I don&rsquo;t remember which ones I saw.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t seen Aliens yet, but might some day.</p><h3 id=a-nightmare-on-elm-street>A Nightmare on Elm Street</h3><p>I loved these movies. Oh and look up some behind the scenes of it.
It is incredibly well made for its time. I love it.</p><p>I found it more like dark humor than horror, but I still love it a ton.
I don&rsquo;t recommend the remake though. I also really love how well
Robert Englund played Freddy.</p><p>It is about a man who haunts people in their dreams.</p><h3 id=little-shop-of-horrors--1986>Little Shop of Horrors (1986)</h3><p>Horror comedy musical movie about a plant shop.
There is obviously something weird going on in the plant shop.</p><h3 id=re-animator>Re-Animator</h3><p>Comedy horror movies about a doctor which reanimates animals and more.</p><p>I have only the first one and it was alright. The last one is apparently
not that great, the second one should be alright too.</p><h3 id=hellraiser>Hellraiser</h3><p>The first few movies were really good, but I didn&rsquo;t like the later ones.
The concept and music is pretty great. I didn&rsquo;t found it scary, but I
found it entertaining.</p><p>It is also pretty well made if you like at some behind the scenes stuff.
Doug Bradley also plays the role of pinhead well.</p><p>Nothing beats &ldquo;A Nightmare on Elm Street&rdquo; for me, when it comes to
watching horror classics for entertainment, but Hellraiser is not
bad at all.</p><p>This movie is about a puzzlebox which is somehow related to
extra-dimensional beings.</p><h3 id=the-collector-and-the-collection>The Collector and The Collection</h3><p>These movies contained gore and torture, but the way that it did was
pretty well done.</p><p>It is about some man which likes to collects people as a hobby. It is
just something which some people do apparently.</p><p>Somethings are not realistic at all though, but I like it a ton more
than the original Saw.</p><p>I also realised that The Collector (2009) movie that I saw wasn&rsquo;t the
original. The original seems great as well.</p><h3 id=the-grudge>The Grudge</h3><p>It is too bad that I haven&rsquo;t seen Ju-On: The Grudge, the original
Japanese one. It is probably even better than the ones I saw.</p><p>I saw the one from 2004, they apparently rebooted it again in 2020.
I usually don&rsquo;t recommend remakes, watch the original one. It is often
better.</p><p>I liked the movies it can be compared to Grave Encounters and Insidious
in a way. The story isn&rsquo;t great, but the movie was pretty well-made.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t like The Ring, but I haven&rsquo;t seen the original Japanese, Ring
movie which is probably good.</p><p>These movies use many jumpscares, but the noises which the Grudge makes
are creepy too. I haven&rsquo;t seen any of the following links.</p><p>Watch or download <a href=https://archive.org/details/JuOnTheCurseJapaneseHorrorFullMovieEnglishSubtitles rel="external nofollow">Ju-On: The Curse (2000)</a> for free (archive.org),

still better than a lot of movies out there in my opinion.</p><div class=link-list><div></div><a href=#the-silence-of-the-lambs>The Silence of the Lambs</a>

horrormovies. It is worth watching though.</p><p>This movie would probably make it higher in some of my other lists.
This list is ranked on how much I liked something or how scary I found
it.</p><p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the prequels &ldquo;Red Dragon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hannibal Rising&rdquo;.
I also didn&rsquo;t see the &ldquo;Hannibal&rdquo; sequel. You might want to watch those
if you liked this movie.</p><h4 id=saw>Saw</h4><p>I only liked the story of the first Saw and didn&rsquo;t really enjoy the
other movies. I haven&rsquo;t seen them all either.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t find it scary either, some people might search for gore
instead of great stories or good atmosphere, unlike me.</p><h4 id=the-wicker-man>The Wicker Man</h4><p>I personally don&rsquo;t really recommend it, but I like how it is different.
It wasn&rsquo;t scary to me, but it had something cool.</p><p>Watch or download <a href=https://archive.org/details/The.Wicker.Man.1973.720p.BluRay.x264.YIFY>The Wicker Man (1972)</a> for free (archive.org)</p><h4 id=human-centipede>Human Centipede</h4><p>The Human Centipede focuses on gore. I have only seen the first one
and it was too predictable in my opinion.</p><p>It is known as a distrubing film and I get that but it wasn&rsquo;t scary to
me. It was just gore and pretty disturbing.</p><p>The medical consequences of what was done was pretty realistic and it
is a good movie IF you want to see gore at its worse form.</p><p>I know that there are much worse films out there, but I am not gonna
mention them here. I don&rsquo;t think that movies like this deserve your
attention.</p><p>The second one is more disturbing than the first one apparently. They
again try to make it more disturbing in the third one.</p><p>I am not sure of they did top it with the third one, since many say that
it was a let down, but I rather watch an interesting less predictable
movie instead.</p><h2 id=weird-stuff-i-guess--series-and-movies>Weird stuff, I guess? (series and movies)</h2><div class=link-list><div></div><a href=#twin-peaks-series-and-movie>Twin Peaks</a>

of the series first. The movie is really worth it.</p><h3 id=dirk-gently-s-holistic-detective-agency-serie>Dirk Gently&rsquo;s Holistic Detective Agency serie</h3><p>Series about a holistic detective, whatever that means.

than the first one. It was pretty bad&mldr; I loved it, because of that.</p><p>Yes, these movies are about Killer Tomatoes.</p><p>Also the opening theme from Return of the Killer Tomatoes is incredibly
good in my opinion. It is funny. Look it up.</p><p>Honestly, I should watch the other movies about it some day.</p><h3 id=the-disaster-artist>The Disaster Artist</h3><p>The Room (2003) was alright too, but it was a bit long and had too much
scenes which I didn&rsquo;t enjoy. It is a great movie to watch in group
though. It is very quotable though.</p><p>The Disaster Artist was overall a pretty funny movie. I liked it.
Actually, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a bad movie.</p><p>It is about the making of The Room, which is known as a &ldquo;so bad it&rsquo;s
good&rdquo; movie.</p><h3 id=rubber--2010>Rubber (2010)</h3><p>A comedy horror movie about a tire which does &ldquo;things&rdquo;.</p><p>Yes, a TIRE. It is weird and a bit funny.</p><h3 id=kung-furie>Kung Furie</h3><p>It is hard to explain this movie, but it is an action comedy. It is
pretty weird, but great.</p><p>Shooting through the phone and things like that are possible. It also
has some weird Characters. It is a mess of things, but it somehow
kinda works.</p><h3 id=hackers--1995>Hackers (1995)</h3><p>Hackers is so bad and some quotable lines. It is good in group.
It is pretty quotable if you are a geek.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t laugh a lot, but seeing where the quotes come from is
nice. It is a movie for computernerds in some ways though.</p><h2 id=other-movies>Other movies</h2><div class=link-list><div></div><a href=#the-imitation-game--2014>The Imitation Game</a>

but the movie gives you some things to think about.</p><p>It is a computer-animated movie about a future in which the Earth has
grewn into a garbage land. WALL-E is the class of robots which is meant
to get the trash.</p><p>Even if you see it as a childish movie. It is a pretty good one in
my opinion. I even have built a lego WALL-E as a kid, so yes I am
a huge fan.</p><p>I also know what some of the abbreviations (robot names) stand for,
but it is a pretty useless thing to know.</p><p>Think about the ending. Is it actually a good ending or not?
Really give it some thought.</p><h2 id=haven-t-seen-but-want-to-see>Haven&rsquo;t seen, but want to see</h2><p>It is possible that I won&rsquo;t like these movies though. I might add
