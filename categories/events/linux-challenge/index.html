<input id=toggle-toc type=checkbox checked><div class="ox-hugo-toc toc"><div></div><div class=heading>Table of Contents</div><ul><li><a href=#what-is-this-challenge>What is this &ldquo;challenge&rdquo;?</a></li><li><a href=#the-questions>The questions</a></li><li><a href=#some-feelings>Some feelings</a></li><li><a href=#red-hat-talk-about-containers>Red Hat talk about containers</a></li><li><a href=#isn-t-this-event-closed-source>Isn&rsquo;t this event closed source?</a></li><li><a href=#thanks-to-dot-dot-dot>Thanks to&mldr;</a></li></ul></div><h2 id=what-is-this-challenge>What is this &ldquo;challenge&rdquo;?</h2><p>The Linux Challenge was a challenge in which questions about the common
commands on GNU and/or Linux systems must be answered within the time.</p><p>It was mostly about knowing the standard coreutils of the GNU project, so more
a GNU challenge as a Linux one. There weren&rsquo;t any question about the Linux
kernel.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think that anyone has the possibility to know everything about the
Linux kernel or all the GNU utils.</p><p>The finals were in Belgium, so it was mainly meant for people from Belgium, but
other people could participate as well.</p><p>I wanted to give this a try, since I use GNU+Linux system. I use it daily,
but this does not necessarily mean that I really know GNU or Linux.</p><figure><img src=../../../images/articles/linux-challenge/linux-challenge-student-winners.jpg alt="The student winners of the Linux Challenge 2019 standing next to each other." width=400 height=210></figure><div class=small-font><div></div><p>The student winners of the Linux Challenge 2019 standing next to each other - I
couldn&rsquo;t find the license, but I am pretty sure that I can use this.</p></div><p>I am the person on the right, with the beard. I finished second of all the
students.</p><h2 id=the-questions>The questions</h2><p>The questions were pretty doable in my opinion, but I am not going to say that
luck isn&rsquo;t a factor. They mentioned that the scores were pretty high in general,
so the ones who did not win should be proud as well.</p><p>Most questions went pretty smoothly, but not all did. I found the way in which
the challenge was done, pretty good and comfortable.</p><h2 id=some-feelings>Some feelings</h2><p>I felt a bit out of my comfort zone when they mentioned my name, since I did
not expect it. I am an introvert and was not very social or talkative during the
event. My dad drove me to the event and was also watching, which did not really
help either. I appreciate the support though.</p><p>I can only blame me for not talking much. It is something that I want to work
on. I am probably not the most asocial introvert, but being asocial happens
from time to time.</p><h2 id=red-hat-talk-about-containers>Red Hat talk about containers</h2><p>There also was a talk from Red Hat about containers. That talk was pretty
interesting. It was a good experience overall. It made me think that containers
could be a solution. I changed my mind after some research.</p><p>There are other ways, which are even better. Some people think that containers
provide more security from hackers, but this is simply not true and managing
containers takes time.</p><p>The approach of the Guix package manager looks very great. This wasn&rsquo;t
mentioned in the talk. The Guix package manager fixes many of the current
container problems. Containers are usually not reproducable, which is not great
for people who care about privacy and security. Guix packs are reproducable.</p><p>GuixSD can even reproduce itself (the current whole system) as a live USB, in a
VM or other things. In other words it is very cool.</p><h2 id=isn-t-this-event-closed-source>Isn&rsquo;t this event closed source?</h2><p>It probably is in some way, but you have to make some decisions. I support free
software, but some privacy sacrifices might be worth it.</p><h4 id=different-opinions>Different opinions</h4><p>I am not someone who complains about words which I don&rsquo;t agree with. I try to
see why others have a different opinion, so that I can learn from that.</p><p>I completely understand why people use the word &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;GNU+Linux&rdquo;
or other words. Linux is just an easier word to market and people know the word.
This does not mean that I agree with the word. The GNU project deserves credit
in my opinion.</p><p>My opinion about the naming problem: <a href=../../../about/the-gnu-linux-system-naming-problem/>The GNU Linux system naming problem</a></p><h4 id=is-everyone-an-hypocrite>Is everyone an hypocrite?</h4><p>Everyone probably depends on some closed source stuff (even if it are just some
protocols or bank card stuff). Everyone probably also depends on free software.
Everyone is probably a hypocrite.</p><blockquote><p>" All solutions are hacks. Every opposite is an equal (and if it attracts, look
out or you&rsquo;ll make a sequel). Freedom&rsquo;s a right but having any means you&rsquo;re
privileged. And our religion of consumerism might have hit a glitch. Clowns are
unhappy. Jugglers drop stuff. I display cowardice whenever you talk tough. My
least favorite thing is a hypocrite, but I&rsquo;ll be one. "</p><p>&ndash; MC Frontalot (Front The Least)</p></blockquote><h2 id=thanks-to-dot-dot-dot>Thanks to&mldr;</h2><p>I would like to thank a friend who told me about this event. I wouldn&rsquo;t have
heard about this event if it wasn&rsquo;t for her. That said, I felt like I owned
her a drink so I bought her one.</p><p>I obviously also should thank the college, which I go to and the organisators
of the event. The college that I go to is called Hogeschool PXL and the
organisators of this event were EDITx and FPS Finance.</p><div id=social-media-links><p><strong>Share</strong></p><p class=link-list><a href="https://share.diasporafoundation.org/?url=https%3a%2f%2fpages.codeberg.org%2fRobinWils%2fcategories%2fevents%2flinux-challenge%2f" rel="external nofollow">Diaspora</a>
