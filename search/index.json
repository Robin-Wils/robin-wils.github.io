The Unix philosophy does not exist  Let\u0026rsquo;s think a bit To make it more complicated   Words which you can use instead  Those words are not perfect either   Conclusion Other interesting links Related article    GNU\u0026rsquo;s Not Unix, Emacs is Unix This article is going to make some people angry, but please read it first before you complain.\nUnix GNU by design does not include Unix code, but what is Unix?\nUnix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the \u0026ldquo;Unix philosophy\u0026rdquo;.\nThis \u0026ldquo;philosophy\u0026rdquo; was made by AT\u0026amp;T, a closed source company. It was invented by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and others.\nThe Unix philosophy The rules of this philosophy have changed over the years, but most definitions include that it only must do one thing well, and only that one thing.\nWhy is GNU Emacs, Unix then? Well, I just want to make it clear that the Unix philosophy is very vague. What is \u0026ldquo;one thing\u0026rdquo;?\nThey sometimes say that it is one responsibility.\nGNU Emacs can be looked at like it has one responsibility, interpreting elisp code. So you could call it Unix.\nDamn, you could even call the Windows Operating System Unix. It does one thing. It does computing (in other words, it is an Operating System).\nSystemd also has one responsibility, being the init system.\nAll these mentioned tools can do more things, but they can be seen as a part of that bigger responsibility.\nThe Unix philosophy does not exist You might think that things can\u0026rsquo;t have such big responsibilities, only small ones like text editing.\nVim only does one thing, which is text editing right? Well what about highlighting the syntax of code? It does that too.\nShouldn\u0026rsquo;t it use a separate program that does that?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s think a bit You should have a separate program for every key on your keyboard if you think like that.\nThe \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; key is only responsible for one thing and that is showing \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; when you press it.\nThe \u0026ldquo;b\u0026rdquo; key is responsible for a different specific thing, which is showing \u0026ldquo;b\u0026rdquo; when you press it.\nDo you get what I mean? The unix philosophy never really existed, because the definition is incomplete and vague.\nI get the point, it is sometimes good that your program does not do too much and that it uses programs which already exist, but Unix is just vague and unclear.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t hate that way of thinking, and believe that parts of it are good, but like everything. Don\u0026rsquo;t follow any vague principle like a religion.\nMost if not all of these design principles are designed by business people. It are buzzwords and you can\u0026rsquo;t use them right or wrong. It are guidelines.\nTo make it more complicated (This section was added after I received some comments on the Fediverse)\nTrademark Unix is also a trademark. So what is Unix? You could say that it is just a trademark.\nThat is not what people mean when they say things like: \u0026ldquo;This program is Unix\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;This program is great because it is Unix\u0026rdquo;.\nAnyway, this is about that thing. What makes a program Unix? What is the Unix philosophy?\nPOSIX There is this other thing that you sometimes hear. \u0026ldquo;It does not have to be POSIX to be Unix.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are many things which people call Unix, which are not POSIX. POSIX is just a standard which you could use.\nVim is not even completely POSIX compliant. It is mostly compliant, but people still call it Unix.\nMacOS is mostly compliant according to some, but many people don\u0026rsquo;t like to call it Unix. Some call it Unix though.\nWords which you can use instead Some people like to say that a program is something. Saying that a program is Unix, does not really describe what you mean in my opinion.\nWords like modular, minimal and composable sound less like meaningless buzzwords in my opinion. They actually describe what you mean.\nThose words are not perfect either They are not perfect, just like the word \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo;. What is \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo;? What is \u0026ldquo;minimal\u0026rdquo;?\nThese words have to do with what you think, but they at least sound less like a buzzword.\nBuzzwords usually are just used to promote stuff and such. Many people don\u0026rsquo;t know what they actually mean, or if it even has meaning.\nConclusion So what Unix is\u0026hellip;, is just a buzzword, a design principle. It is also a trademark.\nYou can follow it, but there is no right or wrong way to apply it.\nIt means multiple things, but this was mostly written to prevent people from yelling that some program is Unix, and some other program is not.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t hate a program because \u0026ldquo;it is not Unix\u0026rdquo;. Don\u0026rsquo;t call any program \u0026ldquo;Unix\u0026rdquo;. It is not some standard. It are guidelines.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t follow any design principle like a religion. It are guidelines, not rules. There is no right or wrong way to do something in design principles.\nPeople like to pretend that some design principles are holy, but they are not. It are guidelines, and it is not something which prevents mistakes and only creates \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; code.\nOther interesting links   Fast Food the UNIX way - Xah Lee  (also check the \"see also\" link)   The Collapse of the UNIX Philosophy - Askar Safin    Related article   The programming culture has problems   ","permalink":"https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/gnu-emacs-is-unix/","tags":["Free-software","Philosophical"],"title":"GNU Emacs is Unix"},{"categories":["articles"],"contents":" Table of Contents  Todo list Friendly Premonition  Deadly Premonition 2 Other Godot project   Watch a bunch of movies Live stream digital art Work a bit on this website Buy a domain name Make a short film    Todo list There is a ton that I want to try.

The criminals didn\u0026rsquo;t spend a ton of time in jail and are free now.\nIt is sad to see that the murder didn\u0026rsquo;t bring any changes in the world, some other horrific murder cases did bring some changes. People should talk more about horrible stuff like this, so that it will not be forgotten.\nCinemas Underbelly did a review about the \u0026ldquo;Junko Furuta Exploitation Collection\u0026rdquo;. It includes some more details, but even more info can be found online.\n Invidious \n Child trafficking is a multi-billion industry Childeren are kidnapped and used every day.\nThe worst part is that big organisations like the CIA, FBI and big companies like Coca Cola are a part of it.

Privacy It blocks ads It pays you Donation system   What I don\u0026rsquo;t like about it    Brave Brave is a FLOSS web browser which includes an ad blocker and gives you free cryptocurrency.\nI know, it sounds like a scam.\n Download Brave \n Why is it good? Privacy It is a step forward in privacy for many people. Most people use Chrome. Brave is based on Chromium and provides some extra security features like using Tor for private windows.\nIt is not as secure as Tor browser and I don\u0026rsquo;t trust Chromium either, but I believe that every browser isn\u0026rsquo;t great for privacy.\nIncluding Tor, even though it is still much better than many other browsers when it comes to privacy.\nIt is not perfect. I2P might be better in many ways, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t looked into it. Not so well-known stuff is sometimes more anonymous, but it can be less secure too.\nThere are so many Firefox based and Chromium based browsers. Most of those browsers don\u0026rsquo;t add many extra features.\nIt blocks ads Brave blocks ads by default, which is neat. The ad blocker is inspired by uBlock Origin and Ghostery.\nThere are still people who don\u0026rsquo;t use an ad blocker. Ad blockers are good for your privacy, since many ads come with trackers. Ads are just annoying. Just block them.\nIt pays you Browsers all kinda suck when it comes to privacy, but Brave does one thing which most other browsers don\u0026rsquo;t do.\nIt pays you, if you allow it to show some small notification like ads in the corner of your screen. This is why I decided to give it a try.\nGo to brave://rewards and make sure that the ads slider is toggled and the auto-contribute slider is not.\nYou have to make an Uphold account to claim the crypto. It isn\u0026rsquo;t the simplest process to go through, but you get a tiny bit of crypto every month. I get around 5 BAT a month from the notification ads.\nYou can get more if you allow donations in Brave Rewards. I configured it. Brave is not a scam and gives you some crypto if you connect an Uphold account.\nUpdate I just realised that you can earn more.\nGo to brave://rewards and click on the tiny settings button which I failed to notice. You can ask Brave to show more ads here, which means more BAT.\n   Screenshot of the location of the Brave Rewards settings button By Robin Wils - CC0 licensed.\n Donation system Brave comes with a donation system. Brave shows tip buttons on some sites and you can use it to donate to people. This is pretty neat.\nWhat I don\u0026rsquo;t like about it  You need an Uphold account to withdraw the money. Uphold works, but I would like more choice. Uphold does not seem so privacy respecting either. I get why they ask some personal data, but I believe that it is not needed. I like Firefox based stuff more than Chromium based stuff. I love the developer tools of Firefox. I would love some more customisation. It has customisation already, but one thing which I absolulety love about Firefox based browsers is the about:config page.  I would recommend abrowser if you want a Firefox based browser. It is what I currently use to test my websites in.\nUsing Firefox also means supporting competition which is good. Choice is great, but getting free crypto is also welcome.\n Download Brave \n","permalink":"https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/brave-browser-is-actually-pretty-alright/","tags":["Free-software","Privacy"],"title":"Brave Browser is actually pretty alright"},{"categories":["articles"],"contents":" Table of Contents  What are these things? So why did you move away from Gitlab?  Gitlab is great Why it is no longer my choice   Codeberg is even better in some ways  The migration More text      What are these things? Gitlab and codeberg are platforms which use Git. Git is a system which tracks your files, code and content.\nGit is useful because it is small and it provides history, so you can go back if you mess something up.\nGitlab and codeberg also allow you to host a static website for free. I use that functionality for this website.\nSo why did you move away from Gitlab? Gitlab is great Gitlab was great for what I did. It provides useful pipelines, which most other Git platforms don\u0026rsquo;t have.\nA pipeline does somethings before your website or other projects gets build. It is useful since it does not publish your result if something went wrong in the pipeline.\nA pipeline can also contain tests and extra scripts. It is very useful.\nIt is also Free Software, which is why I prefer it over Github (Github is closed source). Codeberg is Free Software as well.\nWhy it is no longer my choice My reason for moving was that the 404 pages no longer worked. I was patient, for a year. The issue still wasn\u0026rsquo;t fixed after a year and it could influence my SEO in a bad way.\nI consider 404 pages important and every good businessperson knows that the users are important, so they should have a good experience. Fixing problems fast is something which users will enjoy.\nA 404 page is very important for some people. Check the previous \u0026ldquo;404 pages no longer worked\u0026rdquo; link for more details.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t hate Gitlab and actually enjoyed using it. In fact, I still use it for some projects and I will use it as a backup by mirroring some of my projects to Gitlab.\nCodeberg is even better in some ways I knew that codeberg supported 404 pages, so I decided to move to codeberg. I had used it before and it looked pretty decent.\nThe migration Some bugs popped up after migrating to codeberg\u0026hellip;\nI created an issue after looking for a fix, and guess what? The amazing developers fixed it in less than an hour!\n\nHa, and by the way. They did this twice!\nYou can take a look at the closed issue if you don\u0026rsquo;t believe me. So the first plus for codeberg is great user support.\nThat is a big plus in my opinion. (This is my opinion. Oh, really is it? Why did I even type this text between these brackets\u0026hellip;)\nMore text One disavantage is that it does not have pipelines, but I used that as an advantage. I have one repository with my hugo source and one with the result now. I use a script to push my code to the other repository.\nSome advantages of codeberg:\n Great user support. Actual working 404 pages. No more Google servers. Gitlab uses the Google servers to host your content. Some people might block the Google servers for privacy reasons. Support competition, codeberg isn\u0026rsquo;t a big name yet, but it might become one. You can find my website source code there. (Sorry, this is a bad joke and I mirror to Gitlab anyways.)  Codeberg is a fork of Gitea. It is light and does not have as many features as Gitlab, but it has good user support in my opinion.\n","permalink":"https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/why-i-moved-from-gitlab-to-codeberg/","tags":null,"title":"Why I moved from Gitlab to codeberg"},{"categories":["projects"],"contents":" Table of Contents  dwmconf useful-wiki Cloud Firewall Better browser engine  Why? How can you achieve extendibility?   Modern new editor    dwmconf The package dwmconf will help you with building a custom dwm configuration. The package will provide you the dwmconf command. This command will have some parameters which will help you with configuring dwm.\nYou can also think about this project for another program. This came to my mind, since many packages of the suckless project aren\u0026rsquo;t that user friendly to install. This can make one of their packages more user friendly to configure.\nuseful-wiki The purpose of this project is to help people with finding the right wiki\u0026rsquo;s quickly.\nCloud Firewall You might have heard of the Cloud Firewall browser extension. The idea is to make the same thing, but as a actual application which runs on your desktop. Firewall blocking by using the Firewall of the system should work better than an add-on which does it by rDNS requests.\nBetter browser engine A browser engine is the core of every web browser. It is the part of the browser which renders your pages.\nThe idea is to create a browser engine with editable options. These options should make it possible to create different configurations.\nSome configurations could focus on privacy while others could focus on a browser with many features for average users.\nWhy? The browser engine market is rather small, but I hear many people complaining that they can\u0026rsquo;t do some things in their browser.\nSome wanted features are:\n Keybindings (Vi and GNU Emacs ones for example) Better control over security settings Default external link configuration (configuration options could be: new tab, new window or default) \u0026hellip;  How can you achieve extendibility? I was thinking of doing this by creating different packages. The basic browser engine should already contain some by default though. A bit like how repositories work. The system which GNU Emacs uses as well.\nModern new editor GNU Emacs does not use code parsers to do the syntax highlighting or at least not by default. The way that it does syntax highlighting is by regular expressions. This can cause incorrect syntax highlighting.\nVi-like things are even worse, since they can\u0026rsquo;t even handle multiple language syntax highlighting in one file.\nI find the way in which GNU Emacs handles packages great, but the editor is becoming more outdated. It works with repositories. The defaults of GNU Emacs aren\u0026rsquo;t great either. I think that parsers or not should be a choice.\nI would like keybindings like Xah Lee has, since he has invested a lot of time in keyboards. Vi and Emacs keybindings are not good when it comes to working for a long time. I do think that keybindings should be a thing which is easily changable.\nI do want a configurable config, just like the GNU Emacs one. It should be lightweight and easy to install. I do want it to be a tiny bit more modern. Some packages could be a bit more heavy, but lightweight alternatives should exist.\n","permalink":"https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/projects/ideas/","tags":null,"title":"Ideas"},{"categories":["pictures"],"contents":"  X         X         X         X       ","permalink":"https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/pictures/dog-pictures/","tags":null,"title":"Dog Pictures"},{"categories":["events"],"contents":" Table of Contents  What is this \u0026ldquo;challenge\u0026rdquo;? The questions Some feelings Red Hat talk about containers Isn\u0026rsquo;t this event closed source? Thanks to\u0026hellip;    What is this \u0026ldquo;challenge\u0026rdquo;? The Linux Challenge was a challenge in which questions about the common commands on GNU and/or Linux systems must be answered within the time.\nIt was mostly about knowing the standard coreutils of the GNU project, so more a GNU challenge as a Linux one. There weren\u0026rsquo;t any question about the Linux kernel.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think that anyone has the possibility to know everything about the Linux kernel or all the GNU utils.\nThe finals were in Belgium, so it was mainly meant for people from Belgium, but other people could participate as well.\nI wanted to give this a try, since I use GNU+Linux system. I use it daily, but this does not necessarily mean that I really know GNU or Linux.\n   The student winners of the Linux Challenge 2019 standing next to each other - I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the license, but I am pretty sure that I can use this.\n I am the person on the right, with the beard. I finished second of all the students.\nThe questions The questions were pretty doable in my opinion, but I am not going to say that luck isn\u0026rsquo;t a factor. They mentioned that the scores were pretty high in general, so the ones who did not win should be proud as well.\nMost questions went pretty smoothly, but not all did. I found the way in which the challenge was done, pretty good and comfortable.\nSome feelings I felt a bit out of my comfort zone when they mentioned my name, since I did not expect it. I am an introvert and was not very social or talkative during the event. My dad drove me to the event and was also watching, which did not really help either. I appreciate the support though.\nI can only blame me for not talking much. It is something that I want to work on. I am probably not the most asocial introvert, but being asocial happens from time to time.\nRed Hat talk about containers There also was a talk from Red Hat about containers. That talk was pretty interesting. It was a good experience overall. It made me think that containers could be a solution. I changed my mind after some research.\nThere are other ways, which are even better. Some people think that containers provide more security from hackers, but this is simply not true and managing containers takes time.\nThe approach of the Guix package manager looks very great. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned in the talk. The Guix package manager fixes many of the current container problems. Containers are usually not reproducable, which is not great for people who care about privacy and security. Guix packs are reproducable.\nGuixSD can even reproduce itself (the current whole system) as a live USB, in a VM or other things.

Everyone probably depends on some closed source stuff (even if it are just some protocols or bank card stuff). Everyone probably also depends on free software. Everyone is probably a hypocrite.\n \u0026quot; All solutions are hacks. Every opposite is an equal (and if it attracts, look out or you\u0026rsquo;ll make a sequel). Freedom\u0026rsquo;s a right but having any means you\u0026rsquo;re privileged. And our religion of consumerism might have hit a glitch. Clowns are unhappy. Jugglers drop stuff.

Why don\u0026rsquo;t you fix it yourself?    The problem Custom 404 pages stopped working a year ago for *.gitlab.io domains. A 404 page is a page which you get when a URL can\u0026rsquo;t be found on a website.\nThe Gitlab issue .\nWhy this is a major bug Frameworks and libraries are more difficult to use Many libraries like React show incredibly useful error messages on the 404 page when stuff stops working.\nIt can break the SEO for websites SEO means how high you rank in search engines. Backlinks (links from other websites to your website) are very important for SEO.\nThose backlinks can link to a completely broken page if a website decides to change some URLs and does not have a working 404 page.\nThe website should show a 404 page instead. Many of my backlinks are going to be invalid now, which is not great.\nWhy this bothers me Well, it is going to affect my SEO. The issue was created last year. I think that such an issue is way too important to ignore. It isn\u0026rsquo;t a minor thing.\nSolutions Buy a domain Another solution is buy yourself a domain and use it. It does work if you use another domain.\nMove to another platform People are going to hate this, but moving to another platform is a solution. Github does not have this problem.\nI would suggest that you host your website there instead until Gitlab fixes this. They will probably lose some users because of this bug, but I overall like Gitlab.\nSure, Gitlab uses the Google servers to host your site on, but it still feels more open than Github (which is owned by Microsoft) and it has wonderful pipelines.\nGitlab has pipelines, which is really useful. It is a reason to move for many people.\nWhat will this website do? I might move to Github pages if this stays broken. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to wait much longer for 404 page support.\nCodeberg had the same problem and it only took them a few hours to fix it, not even a day. I will probably move to codeberg pages.\nI migrated my site to codeberg.\nMoving also means that I would lose much SEO, but it might also mean that it might not happen again.\nWhy don\u0026rsquo;t you fix it yourself? Well, I have other stuff to do and I believe that Gitlab has a pretty big codebase. It would require much time.\n","permalink":"https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/gitlab-404-pages-problem/","tags":["Free-software"],"title":"Gitlab custom 404 pages are still broken"},{"categories":["recommendations"],"contents":" Table of Contents  Ad blockers  Host file AdNauseam uBlock Origin   Passwords  KeePassXC   HTTPS  Smart HTTPS (revived)   Disabling JavaScript  NoScript Security Suite GNU LibreJS   Block tracking  Cloud Firewall Privacy Possum   Theming  Stylus   More privacy add-ons  TorSwitch User-Agent Switcher uMatrix   Suggestions to expand this list    Ad blockers Host file Ad blockers usually block most ads, but they increase the amount of memory and CPU.

Online password managers also get leaked sometimes and this is the reason why I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t recommend them.\nA password manager is also pretty easy to use.

Supports blocking Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Cloudflare. Cloud Firewall has a whitelisting option, so that it can disable blocking on specific websites.\nI highly recommend this add-on.

My experience at FOSDEM Projects that I had not heard of  Sourcehut KDE Itinerary MuseScore   Other projects  GNU/Linux phones Haiku GNUnet Matrix Even more projects      What is FOSDEM?   Copyright © FOSDEM - CC BY 2.0 BE licensed. Changes: compressed the image and changed the size of the image.\n FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Belgium in Brussels.\nMy experience at FOSDEM FOSDEM was great, just like last year.\nThere were a lot of interesting talks. I actually met someone from the Fediverse this year. We missed out on meeting an other person who uses the Fediverse, because we just couldn\u0026rsquo;t find each other. Hey, at least I met someone which is cool.\nI met OTheB at FOSDEM. He is developing his own programming language. We had some nice talks.\n Website\n  Mastodon \n I didn\u0026rsquo;t talk to many of the stands this year. We saw many talks though. You can\u0026rsquo;t do everything.\nI enjoyed it and would go again. I am not saying that it is for everyone, since it is about free and open software and that might be a bit too nerdy/geeky for some people.\nProjects that I had not heard of Sourcehut Sourcehut is a platform for Git, like Gitlab and Github. The cool thing about Sourcehut is that people don\u0026rsquo;t have to create an account to contribute to projects. It also uses bash scripts, so you can easily make some kind of pipeline.\nIt looks very promising. Honestly, it is possible that Github or Gitlab uses the same idea some day.\nKDE Itinerary KDE Itinerary is a digital traveling assistant focused on protecting your privacy. I think that it is not fully free (as in freedom), but it surely looks great. You no longer need the google API to travel.\nI really recommend to check this one out.\nMuseScore MuseScore is a free and open-source program to create, play and print music sheets. The fun part was when I got home and my sister (who plays violin) said that she knew it and actually used it.\nOther projects GNU/Linux phones The KDE and Pine stands were always packed with people. Those stands had the new GNU/Linux phones. There were some interesting talks about the phones as well.\nI personally am going to wait until more phones have been released. OTheB ordered the Librem5 when they asked for donations. It is cool that these things exist now. I really look forward to getting one, when the time is right.\nHaiku Haiku is an free and open-source operating system based on BeOS. BeOS is an OS from 1995. They had gratis disks with Haiku on it. I managed to get one and installed it on my previous laptop.\nIt really feels like a system from a few years ago. I am not sure what I am going to use it for. It is different than many operating systems, and that is cool in a way. I hope that some software runs on it.\nGNUnet We managed to catch a talk about GNUnet. GNUnet is a new more secure implementation for the internet. It replaces every layer in the OSI model.\nIt was pretty technical, but it was worth it. Some layers of GNUnet are ready to use. They are talking to many other organizations and already have standardized some parts of the new model. GNS which will replace DNS has been through that process already.\nKeep in mind that it will take a few years before you can use it in production environments.\nAnother cool thing is that GNUnet, written in C, can be extended on. It can be done in different languages. So you can basically replace a part in the model with your own code.\nMatrix I have been negative about Matrix before in my Cloudflare article, but lets look at reality. It is getting more popular and is a solution for connecting different messaging systems. I still don\u0026rsquo;t want to use it, but they are doing something cool. I rather avoid Cloudflare on things which I use often.\nEven more projects There were too many projects to mention them all. Nextcloud, Gitlab, Godot and many other unmentioned projects were also there. Most projects at FOSDEM are awesome, so don\u0026rsquo;t think that this list contains all the awesome projects.\n","permalink":"https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/events/fosdem-2020/","tags":null,"title":"FOSDEM 2020"},{"categories":["articles"],"contents":" Table of Contents  Why Wayland?

Drivers Some drivers seem to rely on Xorg, like some drawing tablet drivers. Some drawing tablet drivers already work though.\nThe closed source NVIDIA drivers are also not supported yet, but honestly use AMD instead if you have the option.\nThere are many reasons to not like NVIDIA for GNU/Linux users, but that article is for another day.\nJumpapp Jumpapp doesn\u0026rsquo;t works with tablayout in Sway. It does work in i3. I highly recommend using tablayout and jumpapp. It increases my productivity a lot.\nSet some jumpapp bindings in your i3 config. Having everything in fullscreen gives you focus. Tiling is a bit overrated in my opinion.\nIt is useful to have a key to have two windows on your screen, but having too many windows on your screen makes things complex.\nKeyboard configuration Some keyboard configuration isn\u0026rsquo;t available on Wayland yet. I can\u0026rsquo;t configure Shift to do Shift lock instead on Wayland.\nSwapping CapsLock with Ctrl worked though. One way around this issue is by making your own keyboard layout. I don\u0026rsquo;t find that user-friendly enough.\nSharing your screen Sharing your screen isn\u0026rsquo;t that well-supported on Wayland yet.

Copyright © FOSDEM - CC BY 2.0 BE licensed. Changes: compressed the image and changed the size of the image.\n FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Belgium in Brussels.\nMy experience at FOSDEM FOSDEM was a great experience. There were a lot of interesting talks. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really socialize with many people, but I talked to some of the stands. I was mainly there for the talks, which were interesting, but it might be better to go for meeting people. It is personal preference.\nI am not saying that it is for everyone, since it is about free and open software and that might be a bit too nerdy/geeky for some people.\nProjects that I had not heard of Open Source Design A community of designers and developers pushing more open design processes and improving the user experience and interface design of open source software.\nApache Beam Apache Beam is an advanced unified programming model. You can choose your language and your runtime with Apache Beam. It is not the easiest thing to explain but it seems useful.\nThe illumos projects I had no idea that solaris based OS\u0026rsquo;s were still around. It is probably something that many people know about, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nGoogle Summer of Code You probably didn\u0026rsquo;t expect Google to be on this list, but I like the idea behind this. Summer of Code is something for students that is supposed to give students an open source project.\nI think that it is a competition, but I am not sure. The cool thing is that it is all about open source. I haven\u0026rsquo;t checked of it also allows free software projects, but I think that it does. Open source is a great start though.\nOther interesting projects GuixSD GuixSD is an advanced distribution which respects the freedom of computer users. This distribution is almost completely written in GNU Guile. This is a distro that I really want to run. It is just so cool.\nLibreOffice LibreOffice is a powerful free (as in freedom) office suite. They were looking for contributors and LibreOffice is a cool project in general.\nFSFE You know that I had to talk to the Free Software Foundation Europe people, since I am a free software enthusiast. Belgium did not have a local group yet, but that can change. I was not the only one who talked about that apparently.\nHey, it is me from the future!: I formed an unofficial local group with people. It might become official some day. Please contact me if you are interested. The FSFE is aware of this. I might write an article about the group some day.\nLibrem 5 A project by Purism (which is a pretty cool company). The Librem 5 is supposed to become the first free (as in freedom) phone.\nI am not sure of it will be that free (as in freedom) when I listened to the answers of some people their questions. They also seemed to still have a few problems. I really want this project to succeed, but I am not sure of it will.\nIt is a great start for new projects. I find it a wonderful project. Many people would like to see something like this in free software.\nEven more projects There were too many projects to mention them all. Nextcloud, Gitlab, Ceph and many other unmentioned projects were also there. Most projects at FOSDEM are awesome, so don\u0026rsquo;t think that this list contains all the awesome projects.\n","permalink":"https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/events/fosdem-2019/","tags":null,"title":"FOSDEM 2019"},{"categories":["articles"],"contents":" Table of Contents  What is the difference?

Both words mean that it is a way to share messages or ideas with others, but it are rather vague words. It is hard to give these words a correct meaning, but I gave it a try.\nSocial media is a part of the media nowadays and many people use the media to impact others. It is the best way to reach people.\nSocial media and the media aren\u0026rsquo;t so different. You can only see a bit of the world at the time, in other words, people have an impact on you all the time.\n   Social media binoculars By Glen Carrie - CC0 licensed.\n Social networking and social media I see social media as the full package which includes media and other stuff. Social networking is usually included in this full package.\nI mean the part in which people chat or talk with others when I use the word social networking. Social networking applications are things like IRC, email, videocalls and chatting.\nSome might see these things as social media, but I see it as a different thing.\nResearch shows us Social media Social media is similar to (or is) a drug and can be bad for your health.\n \u0026quot; Around one-third of humans on the planet are using social media, and some of these people are displaying maladaptive, excessive use of these sites. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ndash; Dar Meshi (lead author and assistant professor at MSU)\n  Research source: Excessive social media users demonstrate impaired decision making in the Iowa Gambling Task; Year: 2019; Authors: Dar B Meshi and Anastassia Elizarova and Andrew R. Bender and Antonio Verdejo-Garcia; Published in: Journal of behavioral addictions;\n Social networking There is research about the positive sides of social networking. Someone who uses a social networking site might be more likely to avoid serious psychological distress.\n Research source: Social Networking Sites and Addiction: Ten Lessons Learned; Year: 2017; Authors: Daria J. Kuss and Mark D. Griffiths; Published in: International journal of environmental research and public health;\n Keep in mind that I don\u0026rsquo;t see social networking as social media. Social networking is a smaller package.\nSocial media disadvantages That research might have shown you, why social media is probably not healthy and addicting, but it has even more disadvantages.\nThere is even a video of the founding president of Facebook who claims that they make it addicting and that they always knew this.\n Watch on invidio.us\n  \u0026quot; It’s a social-validation feedback loop\u0026hellip; exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology. \u0026quot;\n\u0026quot; The inventors, creators \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s me, it\u0026rsquo;s Mark, it\u0026rsquo;s Kevin Systrom on Instagram, it\u0026rsquo;s all of these people \u0026ndash; understood this, consciously. And we did it anyway. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ndash; Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook\n Fake news It usually contains a lot of propaganda and lies. It can contain some truths as well, but many people also believe the lies, since they don\u0026rsquo;t have the time or are too lazy to do some research.\nPeople get paid to promote stuff. Social media is still a marketing tool. The media also has this problem.\nPrivacy problems Many people including kids, probably don\u0026rsquo;t read the extreme policies which you accept by making a social media account.\nSome policies of the popular Facebook network allow them to:\n Use all the information which they receive about you. That includes things which you haven\u0026rsquo;t done yet. Nothing you do on Facebook is private. (This gives them permission to constantly spy on you); Collect information about things which you do after you leave their website; Use your identity, even in ads; Give your data to partners. Partners can mean a lot;  Keep in mind that this isn\u0026rsquo;t even everything. I recommend the \u0026ldquo;Terms of Service; Didn’t Read\u0026rdquo; add-on if you want to see the Words of Service in a more readable format.\nTerms of Service; Didn\u0026rsquo;t Read This extension informs you instantly of your rights online by showing an unintrusive icon in the toolbar. You can click on this icon to get summaries from the Terms of Service; Didn\u0026rsquo;t Read initiative.\nLicense: AGPLv3\n Website  Github \n  Firefox  Chromium  Opera  Safari \n It costs you time Your time is valuable. Life’s short. Don\u0026rsquo;t let social media eat your time, many people don\u0026rsquo;t realize how much time social media really takes. Not much (if even anything) is worth living a life that you wouldn’t like. Nothing is worth putting aside what you have always wanted to be.\nGood reasons to use social media Is using it to stay in contact with others any good? Using it to have contact with others is a bad reason in my opinion.\nPeople who care about you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t abandon you if you care about your privacy and/or your health when you move to a different platform. It might be less easy to use, but that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t matter.\nYour good friends will try to stay in touch in some other way. Your other \u0026ldquo;friends\u0026rdquo;, you probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t trust them too much. People use others to reach their goals all the time.\nSocial media is probably not going away soon. It is important to know your limit if you decide to use that poison. Test what it does to you if you spend a few weeks without social media.\nI feel better in general when I stop using social media for a while. Do what feels right in the long run and play with the options. How much time on social media is too much?\nTo influence people This is the only good reason that I could find to use social media. Influencing people is useful when you try to sell a product or an idea.\nIt is just the fastest and easiest way to market something. Many people use it and it works. There are other ways though. I add share links, so that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to have an account on those platforms.\nMy share links don\u0026rsquo;t use any tracking JavaScript, since I don\u0026rsquo;t find it ethical to track users.\nShare buttons The Facebook like buttons violate the GDPR and I bet that it isn\u0026rsquo;t the only social media button which tracks everything you do, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a Facebook account. This is a reason why some people like myself often block JavaScript.\nI added custom share links for these platforms. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I won\u0026rsquo;t use the buttons which these platforms provide. I cares about your privacy. It is just a way to get my content to the people who aren\u0026rsquo;t aware of these problems.\nKeep in mind that I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend you to stay on those closed source platforms! I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend it, since you give them an extra user. These platforms only exist because of their users (and usually also the personal data of those users).\n   Facebook pills, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the original creator of the picture - CC0 licensed.\n Social networking Social networking I already mentioned why it is probably a better choice as social media\u0026hellip; but it also has some disadvantages.\nDisadvantages The current most used social networking platform is probably email. Email has a lot of problems, but most people still use it because it is easy to use.\nSome, but far from all of those problems are spam. It is easy to spoof(fake) an email address and it is not encrypted by default. No encryption by default means that anyone who uses a packet analyzer on your network can see and read the contents of your emails.\nEmail is easy to use because the most people have it. It also isn\u0026rsquo;t too hard to use. Many sites use email to validate your account. Disposable email services exist if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to share your email with a website.\nIs it possible to not have these problems? It depends.\nThe problem is that good alternatives exist, but the communities are a bit small, so the norm isn\u0026rsquo;t using these platforms yet. This makes it harder to find people to have conversations with.\nYou can use these alternatives which might fix many of the problems which email has as a solution.\nTips for new social networking platforms Email is something which most people have, because most people need it to validate themselves on websites. Make sure that your social networking platform has something like that.\nMark my words, email will probably stop being used some day. It could be your platform that replaces it. Think about how you can make it attractive to the norm.\n","permalink":"https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/media-and-social-media/","tags":["Privacy","Health","Social-media"],"title":"Media and social media"},{"categories":["about"],"contents":" Table of Contents  Install a theme  Dark theme Stylus add-on Themes   Add your own theme    Install a theme You can install a theme by installing the Stylus add-on on your browser, and by adding one of the listed themes to the add-on by clicking on the name of the theme.\nDark theme The default theme can change based on your theme settings.

What is Cloudflare?   Say no to Flarecloud logo By Robin Wils - CC0 licensed.\n Cloudflare is: Cloudflare is a content delivery network, which means that it has different servers in different locations. Websites which use Cloudflare should be better reachable, so faster in different countries.\nCloudflare is not just a content delivery network. Cloudflare is also a reverse proxy (= a middleman between the user and a website), a DDoS mitigation service (= a service which tries to resist or make the impact of a DDoS attack less painful).\nCloudflare is even more as that. Many websites are a part of the Cloudflare content delivery network.\nIn easy words: Cloudflare claims to try to make sites faster and more secure. It is a service which a lot of websites use.\nSounds pretty nice, right?\nPrivacy problems Do you want to disallow people who need and deserve the right on privacy from using your website?\nGreat! Use Cloudflare!\nReverse proxy A reverse proxy acts as a man-in-the-middle, which means that it might spy on everything which your users do. Cloudflare is a reverse proxy.\nA man-in-the-middle service is something which is between the site and the user. This means that they can easily add JavaScript which spies on you.\nIt keeps a globally-unique ID Cloudflare creates a cookie which gives your browser a globally-unique ID. This even happens when the website is using SSL and shows a little padlock in your browser.\nThis pretty much kills privacy. A globally-unique ID can easily be used to track you.\nTor Cloudflare sites usually block Tor. Cloudflare does not provide you anonymity even if it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t block Tor. Cloudflare would let people use Tor, if they really cared about security. Tor is made for security.\nThey technically don\u0026rsquo;t always block Tor access, but the reCAPTCHAs don\u0026rsquo;t function correctly, which can make it hard to visit a Cloudflare site through Tor.\nYou might be able to change this in the security settings for your site. Keep in mind that most sites won\u0026rsquo;t do this.\nSource: The Trouble with Cloudflare - Tor Blog\nGoogle CAPTCHAs Not all sites with Cloudflare use CAPTCHAs, but many do. CAPTCHAs are the things which try to check if you are \u0026ldquo;human\u0026rdquo;.\nIt sends your personal data to Google, since it uses the CAPTCHA from Google, which does more than just checking if you are a robot. Some people even claim that it tries to find out which human you are.\nRemember that Google is an advertisement company. Most of their money comes from selling your data. In fact the privacy policy which you accept by using almost any Google product allows them to do this.\nThe funny thing is that there are computer programs (robots), which can solve the \u0026ldquo;prove you are human\u0026rdquo; CAPTCHAs.\nGoogle Privacy Policy\nBuster Buster is a browser extension which can solve reCaptchas. CAPTCHAs can be solved by clicking on the extension button at the bottom of the reCAPTCHA widget.\nLicense: GPLv3\n Firefox  Chromium  Opera \n Project Honey Pot Project Honey Pot is a project which collects a lot of user data and much of that data is from innocent users who deserve privacy. Cloudflare was created by people who worked on that project.\nCloudflare has leaked private user data before, so it has something in common with \u0026ldquo;Project Honey Pot\u0026rdquo;.\nCompanies which don\u0026rsquo;t show the source code probably don\u0026rsquo;t show it for a reason. Spying might be one of them. Showing the source code is usually a great way to find bugs and to improve your code.\nI will probably say more about this in another article.\nFirefox and Cloudflare Mozilla (Firefox) has partnered up with Cloudflare and will resolve the domain names from the application itself via a DNS server from Cloudflare. Cloudflare will then be able to read everyone\u0026rsquo;s DNS requests.\nYou can disable it in \u0026ldquo;about:config\u0026rdquo;. The string value of \u0026ldquo;network.trr.uri\u0026rdquo; should be empty. Some other settings can also contain Cloudflare URLs. It is recommended to search for \u0026ldquo;cloudflare\u0026rdquo;. GNU Icecat and older Firefox versions are not affected yet. Tor Browser is also Firefox based, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to use Tor Browser to use Tor.\n   (Screenshot) The Firefox about:config Cloudflare DNS settings By Robin Wils - CC0 licensed.\n Keep in mind that the configured DNS resolver of your computer might be Cloudflare DNS. You can find guides on the internet about setting the DNS nameservers.\nI recommend the Quad9 DNS resolver. Some of their DNS nameservers use DNSSEC, which means that your DNS queries aren\u0026rsquo;t in plain text. This means that it provides you extra privacy. Quad9 is a nonprofit organisation. It looks trustworthy enough.\nKeep in mind that DNS is just a pretty insecure protocol by default.\nMost GNU and/or Linux systems have a /etc/resolv.conf file, but programs like wicd and NetworkManager change these settings. Those programs usually have a settings menu to set the DNS nameservers.\nThink about your visitors Do you like it when websites ruin a bit of your experience?\nIn other words: Would you love to visit a website which forces you to solve a annoying timewasting puzzle usually after waiting five seconds which also cost you valuable time?\nAwesome! Use Cloudflare!\nYour users matter Every visitor helps. Think about their experience. They make your website successful. They like to see your content. They probably would like it when the website opens quickly without too many junk.\nWho is your userbase\u0026hellip; and what do they like? Focus on them. Some of them probably care about their privacy. You will have fewer visitors if you don\u0026rsquo;t support them. That influences the success of your website.\nI highly doubt that they will like:\n To solve a CAPTCHA; To wait for five seconds for no good reason.  What possible users which care about privacy probably won\u0026rsquo;t like:\n That your site isn\u0026rsquo;t easily reachable through Tor; That your site is hosted by some company which many people don\u0026rsquo;t trust. (I know that this site still uses the Google servers, I still need to fix that, but I currently don\u0026rsquo;t spend any money on this website.); That the JavaScript which the site uses is necessary; That the JavaScript isn\u0026rsquo;t freely licensed. Some people like myself try to use GNU LibreJS (or even disable JavaScript) when it is possible.  Just to be clear People who care about privacy aren\u0026rsquo;t criminals, or at least not always. In fact, everyone needs privacy in one way or another. Everyone has the right to privacy.\nPeople who really think that they don\u0026rsquo;t need privacy should be ok with sending me their address, private conversations, access to their webcam, passwords and more. Don\u0026rsquo;t actually do this.\nAn important example are whistleblowers. They have in many cases shared useful information. Many of them can lose their job if they aren\u0026rsquo;t anonymous enough.\nLegal \u0026ldquo;.onion\u0026rdquo; sites exist. Some examples of this are:\n Facebook (closed source social media) DuckDuckGo (Search engine, the core of this search engine is closed source) Protonmail (webmail, the mobile app is closed source) \u0026hellip;  More information about Tor   7 things you should know about Tor - EFF    Who uses Tor - Tor Project    How can you fight against Cloudflare? That is a excellent question.\nIt isn\u0026rsquo;t simple to not use websites which aren\u0026rsquo;t served by things like Cloudflare without any extra tools. Cloudflare is a big privacy problem. I however have tips for the people who care about privacy.\nExtensions There are browser extensions which fight against this problem. I recommend the Cloud Firewall add-on.\nCloud Firewall The Cloud Firewall add-on can block connections to pages and web resources hosted in major cloud services if the user wishes to do so. Supports blocking Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Cloudflare. Cloud Firewall has a whitelisting option, so that it can disable blocking on specific websites.\nLicense: GPLv3\n  Firefox\n  A bash script which I wrote I wrote a simple bash script which can be used to block or unblock the Cloudflare IPs by using iptables. This script was made for GNU and Linux operating systems. I wrote this before I knew about the Cloud Firewall add-on.\n Codeberg (git)\n I started writing an add-on which can be used to block Cloudflare. I discontinued the project when I heard about the Cloud Firewall add-on.\nTell others about the danger of Cloudflare You can ask websites to not use Cloudflare. Please do so in a respectful way. Mentioning why Cloudflare is not the best option might help. I recommend that you recommend them an alternative. (Feel free to send me some alternatives, I want to list some of them on this website)\nYou could write an article or share other people their articles with other people. Make more people aware of this problem.\nFeel free to use the images on my site which are CC0 licensed. CC0 means that it is public domain licensed, which means that you can use it for any purpose. There are no restrictions.\nEven more reasons The Stop Cloudflare repository The following git repository contains more reasons and links to articles of other people. I highly recommend checking it out.\nIt is an amazing source of information. The structure of the repository might make it a bit hard to look through it. Many who read this probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have problems with finding what they are looking for.\nCloudflare article.txt  from the Stop Cloudflare repository .\nKnowing this, also changed me Removing Matrix Matrix.org apparently also uses Cloudflare, so I decided to remove my matrix account after writing this article. I don\u0026rsquo;t see it as something which offers you privacy if it decides to use Cloudflare.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t recommend Matrix because of this problem. Even if it might be solvable by self-hosting, since you probably will recommend it to friends. Those friends might decide to use the official Matrix server. Those friends could be using Cloudflare without knowing the dangers of it.\nFediverse problems Avoiding all Cloudflare sites is probably not easy, but I will do what I can. The content on the Fediverse can be served by Cloudflare, but it only serves the content of other instances which use Cloudflare through Cloudflare.\nI use the Cloud Firewall add-on and won\u0026rsquo;t whitelist the instance which I use, which means that I can\u0026rsquo;t see the pictures and some other media when I am using Mastodon or Pleroma.\nI changed again, after a few extra months Is privacy worth it? I think that productivity matters more than privacy. There are tools which provide productivity while also being better for security and privacy. Take a look at KeePassXC for example.\nI would go for the more secure alternative if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt my productivity too much. I do this because I still want to support privacy for the people who need it.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong privacy is important, but not enough people fight for it. Make sure that you are a bit more secure than average users, but don\u0026rsquo;t overdo it.\n  Privacy focused software - contains reasons to care about privacy   How important is online privacy? - contains thoughts about online privacy, is the extra effort worth it?

Day against DRM 2019 Why is it bad?  It encourages piracy You can lose your product It can prevent people from using it Some other reasons   My experience with DRM How can you help?    What is DRM?   DRM means Digital Right Management, but some opponents of DRM prefer to call it Digital Restrictions Management.\nIt is a method to prevent the customer from doing certain things like making copies. DRM is a tool that restricts the user from doing certain things. DRM is about restrictions, not rights.\nDay against DRM 2019 Day against DRM focused on ebooks during 2019.\nMicrosoft deleted thousands of ebooks from ebook readers, smartphones and other devices.\nStudents had DRM on some textbooks in schools. Some students couldn\u0026rsquo;t access these textbooks because of the DRM on the textbooks. Everyone has the right on education, so why do people use DRM, which prevents many people from reading textbooks?\nThere are dust jackets available to print out and wrap around books. Please spread the word.\nWhy is it bad? It encourages piracy It fails to prevent people to illegally pirate the product. Many users who pirate a product don\u0026rsquo;t seem to have problems with DRM, since people can remove the DRM. It is probably illegal to remove it, but pirating is illegal as well.\nThe legal consumers who purchase a product seem to have the problems. This seems to encourage piracy, but it was probably made to prevent it.\nDo companies really believe that DRM is good for the marketshare of the product?\nYou can lose your product It is possible that you can lose a product, which you paid for. It has happened before and people don\u0026rsquo;t always get their money back.\nMany products which use DRM can\u0026rsquo;t be accessed without internet. This means that you lose the product when the servers go offline or when people decide to remove the product from the server.\nI repeat: Do companies really believe that DRM is good for the marketshare of the product?\nIt can prevent people from using it DRM capabilities on PDFs allow the maker of for example a PDF to block the ability to use a screen reader with it. This prevents blind people from making use of that content.\nI repeat again: Do companies really believe that DRM is good for the marketshare of the product?\nSome other reasons  DRM can track you; DRM also often hurts the performance of your product; DRM is simply bad for the consumers.  My experience with DRM I use a windows 10 KVM for college purposes. The steam trap caught me before I knew about DRM and free software. I will probably leave steam some day.\nThe steam alternative that I recommend is GOG. GOG is DRM-free. The struggle of not being able to play some games without internet is not the nicest thing to experience.\nI do not play a lot of games nowadays, since I have other things to do. Time is limited, so I prefer to work on projects instead of playing games.\nHow can you help? There are many ways to fight against DRM. Defective by design has a campaign against DRM every year.

I had never been to a musical before. I had, however, seen \u0026ldquo;Little Shop of Horrors\u0026rdquo; which is a musical. I highly recommend it and Ryako also likes it.\nThe costume designs were neat and the actors performed well in my opinion. The Chorus was great as well. I enjoyed it and was not disappointed.\nThe play was \u0026ldquo;Kiss Me, Kate\u0026rdquo; written by Samuel and Bella Spewack with music and lyrics by Cole Porter. A musical adaptation of Shakespeare’s \u0026ldquo;A Taming of the Shrew\u0026rdquo; directed by Fred Graham.\nTalking with Ryako Ryako did not have much time, but she was very kind. She gave me a bag with merch, gave me a hug and we had a chat.\nShe gave me a lot of merch (including a T-shirt which is not in the picture since I was wearing it). I expected to get nothing, but I got so much. She was able to do so much in such a small time.\n   Picture of the merch, which I got from Ryako, which is laying on my laptop - CC0 licensed.\n \nThe picture with her was made pretty quick.

She also was busy with the Nerdcore VPC which you might know. I believe that she will make it in the genre. Her voice is great.\nShe will have more time for music now that the event has passed. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to ask a lot of questions because of the time. She also likes Twin Peaks which is awesome.\nMore about Ryako I find her website well designed.

It is about maintaining the peace. I like it.\nThe Original Series I loved the original series. It was funny and interesting. My favorite captian, so far is the original one, captain Kirk.\nI also love the characters which don\u0026rsquo;t get that much screen time like Sulu. I really liked his acting.\nThe first episode was also so great. I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to like Star Trek, but I was enjoying it.

What is normal? Normal is the norm, being standard, a regular pattern. Normal is fitting in with the majority of people.\nThe word normal can mean something else for some people because they see other things as normal. This article is about the word normal as in living like the norm.\nMy thoughts I believe that no one is normal. Some people just try to look or act normal. I don\u0026rsquo;t see myself as a normal person either.\nDisadvantages of being different Not everyone likes that you are different People might bully you because you are different. You might be an easier target compared to others. This might be the biggest disadvantage, but this comes with a lot of advantages as well.\nHaters Everyone has different opinions. You can never be good for everyone. The norm might have some different opinions which might get you some haters.\nYou can try to change people their opinions, but remember that it is not easy to convince someone. Start with small things to see if they want to be convinced.\nPeople who follow the norm might get hate as well, but the norm is bigger as the rest. You could get more hate if you don\u0026rsquo;t follow the norm.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t try to be different just to be different, dare to be yourself. Being different to be different doesn\u0026rsquo;t really seems to have a purpose. There are better (and more valid) reasons to be different.\nPeople expect you to fit in You might have to make some sacrifices if you want to be what you like. I, for example, go to a college which uses closed-sourced software, and I don\u0026rsquo;t like many things which they teach. You sometimes just can\u0026rsquo;t seem to be who you would like to be.\nThis does not mean that I hate those people. I believe that hating does not give enough value back. It is probably not worth it. Some people found my keyboard layout pretty cool while others thought that it was weird, but I see that as a good thing.\nAdvantages of being different You are different and stand out People might remember you because you are different. You might stand out a bit. Standing out might even give you more chances to get success. It takes courage to stand out so it might also make you a stronger person.\nWould you rather hire someone with many cool skills or someone who is a part of the norm?\n \u0026quot; If you ain\u0026rsquo;t some kind of crazy, you ain\u0026rsquo;t shit.

You might have more important questions and statements which you can use in a discussion.\nWhat if? You will never see what you could be if will always try to fit in with the norm.

You can have big goals, but doing too much might cause a lot of stress or other unpleasant symptoms.\nYou can become more productive. Try to believe in yourself and take your time, but don\u0026rsquo;t waste too much of it either.\nUse better tools or make the task easier This is not always possible, but it could help a lot. It might even be possible to automate a task, which means less work and more time for you.\nHow I made it easier to write this blog Writting posts in pure HTML took time, since I had to surround the text with tags.

I can write my website in the org-mode of GNU Emacs now. I can type and create articles easier in org. This saves time. This is just a simple example, but it has more useful features.\nOrg-mode example:\n * This is a headline This is a textblock.  This is another textblock. Eliminate useless tasks It is completely normal to need some time to relax. Some relaxing things can be productive. You could try to replace less productive relaxing things with more productive relaxing tasks.\nFor example, replace games with watching educational videos or try to learn an extra skill which you find relaxing. Creating a own website is also something which you could learn from.\nGames might be useful if you are a game developer and/or seek inspiration, but they usually do more harm as good for the most people. You could seek info about the game instead of playing it if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to waste too much time.\nThere are debatable execeptions like educational games or playing games for the art. I don\u0026rsquo;t find most of the popular games that much of an art piece, but some games are trully wonderful.\nSocial media is also a timewaster which you might want to avoid. This isn\u0026rsquo;t the only reason to avoid it. You can read my Media and social media article for more information.\nDo you can something back for your time? Productive activities usually give you something back after a period of time. Something that you can see as an achievement. Learning something is a task which returns knowledge. Making a project might even return you donations. Drawning something might improve your drawning skills, which can also get you money or respect.\nIt is all in the details I have to admit that I usually also waste more time as I want to waste. Some things which you might not think about, might take a lot of time. It is probably also just healthy to not be too busy.\nThink about the tiny things which you do. Even putting pens which were inside a closet in a cup on a desk might help. This makes it easier to get the pen when you need it. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to open the closet and it is easy to pick up.\nDo something productive every day Big improvements don\u0026rsquo;t always happen in one day. Working hard can help to get where you want to be. Do something productive every day. This can be something simple.\nI try to do a small git commit every day. Not every commit looks valuable, but you improve something a tiny bit. A lot of tiny bits make something big.\nThere are exceptions though. You could get sick. It is good to push yourself, but everyone has a limit. You might need a break when you get sick.\nFocus on one task Many people can work better when they focus on only one thing. Multitasking often slows you down.\nMultitasking is not always bad. Listening to music while doing something might increase your productivity depending on the task and music.\nTiny tasks can usually be multitasked in my experience, but bigger ones can\u0026rsquo;t. You decide how tiny or big, tiny and big is.\n","permalink":"https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/how-to-get-more-done/","tags":["Philosophical"],"title":"How to get more done"},{"categories":["about"],"contents":" Table of Contents  People start to assume things It takes time Not everyone understands you You can\u0026rsquo;t avoid politics So, which party did Robin Wils vote for?

Ha, you don\u0026rsquo;t format your code like this and you don\u0026rsquo;t use the \u0026ldquo;cloud\u0026rdquo;. You must be a bad programmer.\n   Image from Episode 13, Season 13 of The Simpsons. It is probably public domain licensed, since it is one of those internet jokes - CC0 licensed.\n All those small things add up. It becomes super annoying. People spread a lot of nonsense about programming.\nThe worst part is that there just is no one right way. People make that stuff up, but you never see any proof. It is something that probably annoys many people.\nYes, some things are a bit better as others, but there is no one true way. You are not superior when you use some new trendy technology. It is probably good to find the right tool for the job, but the best tool can be something else for someone else.\nThere is no such thing as the perfect programming language People just should teach others how to use a language correctly. There are different styles and ideas in the programming culture because we are people. We like different things.\nFacts matter. Some languages are indeed faster or easier for some jobs, but that does not mean that everyone likes the syntax of that language. Syntax can make a language more easy to use for some people, so it is something that could matter.\nYou might find a programming language the best language, but remember that it is not the best language for every purpose or everyone.\nPeople just want to see a tool that works pretty fine in the end. You can develop it will a language which you enjoy. Think about the product which you want to make. It might even be great to think about you audience. You might want to pick another language as C# if you want to make a Free Software tool for example.\nWhat are the programming languages which fit your goals? Compare them. It might be useful to include the difficulty to learn the language as a factor.\nSoftware quality There are a few important factors to reach software quality:\n How good can the programmer(s) program (having a degree doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean that you are good at it. I mean that you actually have knowledge, experience and skill.); How much do(es) the programmer(s) know about the project (It is useful to know something about money if the tool in development is a money management tool or something); How good the programmers work in team (if there is a team). How good you are at design patterns. This also depends on what you program. It might be less needed for some things.  Things which bother me Which methodology should you use? A better question might be: Does the methodology really matter?\nNone of these methodologies tend to be proven. Many of these methodologies change after a few years. It all sounds like a bunch of nonsense. They might help a bit, but how essential are they?\nMany great software has been developed without your \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo; methodology. I am not saying that it is bad to follow one. It might help for some people, but it is not essential and it isn\u0026rsquo;t a strict thing. Some people follow some of these things to the details, which might waste more time instead of getting things done.\nA small successful project can even be developed without any methodology. In fact, there is for example proof which shows that the popular Test Driven Development method isn\u0026rsquo;t always great.\nKeep in mind that design patterns are something different. I think that most of those make sense and can make you a better programmer.\nExamples of problems with methodologies TDD\nArticle: Problems with TDD - dalke scientific\nI know that the mentioned link is old, but it does contain some interesting text. Testing often helps, but I believe that TDD is not always needed. I agree that it does not cover every situation.\nThere are often some unexpected things which you probably want to have. Take for example a shopping website with coupons. People can try to add as much coupons, so that they get things free. This is probably something which you don\u0026rsquo;t want.\nIt is possible that you don\u0026rsquo;t reach a fix for that problem in TDD. Thinking like a user who tries to cause harm often helps to make your program more secure. This is not needed in TDD. This is why I think that TDD is not the only way.\nExtra testing can help. Trying a bunch of things when your program is finished can help to discover a lot of small problems. TDD can help, but don\u0026rsquo;t trust methodologies completely. They are not perfect.\nAgile\n \u0026quot; The word “agile” has become sloganized; meaningless at best, jingoist at worst. We have large swaths of people doing “flaccid agile,” a half-hearted 7 attempt at following a few select software development practices, poorly. We have scads of vocal agile zealots—as per the definition that a zealot is one who redoubles their effort after they’ve forgotten their aim. \u0026quot;\n\u0026quot; And worst of all, agile methods themselves have not been agile. Now there‘s an irony for you. \u0026quot;\n\u0026mdash; Andy Hunt, one of the founders of The Agile Manifesto\n  Full article: The Failure of Agile\n I don\u0026rsquo;t even agree with his opinion. Following something strict can be great, but following it too strict can be a problem as well. It can cause fights over things which might not really matter.\nIt is good to have discussions, but try to use good reasons in a discussion.\nNew technology is not always better For example a simple webpage can ask for a lot of resources nowadays. Those resources can be used for tracking.\nI am fine if it asks resources for some advanced functionality\u0026hellip; but for SPYING? Are you serious? Spying?\nMany companies still see spying as a good thing, since selling personal data makes them money. This looks unethical to me.\nThere are other ways. You can, for example ask your users for feedback.\nBuzzwords Buzzwords are everywhere. It isn\u0026rsquo;t really specific to the programming culture. The thing about buzzwords is that they are usually not needed.\nA funny thing is that many smart people are great at explaining complex things in simple ways. They also seem to try to avoid buzzwords. The people who use it on purpose usually do it to look smarter as they are.\nIt might be likely that you don\u0026rsquo;t really understand the meaning of a word, if you use a buzzword.\nWe obviously need words to talk, but most buzzwords seem useless, since they don\u0026rsquo;t have a clear meaning. Use a different word or sentence instead if you can.\nTry to use words which most people understand\u0026hellip; Yeah, I get it buzzwords often help with marketing an idea or products and we often use them without realizing it.\nRelated article   GNU Emacs is Unix  - Explanation of why Unix is an unclear word   People who spread that a programming job is fun Programming as a hobby is fun, but I thought about doing it as a job for a moment and realized that it is not what it seems. Doing it as a job usually means that you can\u0026rsquo;t choose what you create.\nThis takes away a lot of my motivation or interest in the job. They can limit what you can learn. A company can say you must use this programming language. The project can be something that you aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in at all.\nHere is a part of a Dual Core song. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get in such a situation. They even mention that the song is made for all the programmers and developers in the song.\n \u0026quot; I know I go and try but my life is broken, pulverized. Work and more and more, there\u0026rsquo;s less time to socialize. And that\u0026rsquo;s just a gamble, so why try and roll the dice? Either in the office or by myself at home, at night. Plus I stopped believing, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason keeping hope alive. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ndash; Dual Core (Unplug - Listen on YouTube)\n It can be a fun job as well, but it depends on more as one factor. Dare to talk about the downsides when you say that it is a fun job. It can be fun for some people, but you have to like the full package.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have a problem with programming as a job, but doing it all day on a project which does not interest me, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t improve my life quality. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy that.\nMy job ideas for the future I find programming nice as a hobby or for own projects, but don\u0026rsquo;t want to do it as a job. I could try to become a programming teacher or try to learn other things which interest me.\nI like to have some freedom. I think that something more creative might be better for me. I should look into 3D-modelling and 2D-animations and stuff. Art like that can take a lot of time, but the important part is that you enjoy it. Programming is not a bad job, but I think that it is not for me.\nMoney is nice, but happiness is important as well. Your time is limited. I recommend that you try to use it in a smart way. Make the best of it.\nGood things about the culture  There are almost always problems which you can try to fix; You often are able to get the opportunity to learn things; Not everyone does the things which bother me (and other people); Some companies treat programmers really well; Working from home might be cool thing, if you like that.  Just keep in mind that every culture has some problems or things which you don\u0026rsquo;t like. This is just my opinion.\nWhat others think Xah Lee is a pretty well-known GNU Emacs user.

The value of an internet meme Spam The internet meme culture Conclusion    What is an internet meme? An internet meme is commonly known as just a meme, which means something else apparently. An internet meme is an activity, concept, catchphrase, or piece of media that spreads, often for humorous purposes, from person to person via the internet.\nThat was a bit of text\u0026hellip; you can usually just replace the word internet meme with internet joke or internet content. The word internet meme is correct, but the word meme is probably technically incorrect.\nThat definition is pretty unclear. A simple avatar or profile picture is an internet meme, according to that definition. The internet memes that I wrote about in this article are the common sometimes funny images and short sometimes funny video formats of the internet memes.\nThe value of an internet meme An internet meme usually does not have a lot of value in my opinion. The jokes can be funny for a few minutes. The fun that you get from it usually does not last long.\nWatching a movie might satisfy you more if you want to have a laugh. Some of the internet memes are art, but most are just the same repitive jokes with different text. Some of them aren\u0026rsquo;t even funny in my opinion.\nSpam Many social media contains so many internet memes that it clutters the content which you might want to see. It can act like spam for the people who don\u0026rsquo;t want to see that content.\nAn internet meme often wastes space for educational or valuable content. Images can make your content more readable, but internet memes also don\u0026rsquo;t look formal in my opinion.\nThe internet meme culture There are different types and sizes of internet memes. Many internet meme communities claim that the internet memes from 9gag and ifunny are poorly made.\nInternet memes are often poorly made. There are exceptions, but even most of the famous 4chan memes are often pretty poorly made in my opinion.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t often visit well-known chans or forums. I usually only visit pages or boards about technology if I do.\nConclusion Internet memes often don\u0026rsquo;t bring a lot of extra value to something. They are often a waste of space. I might even block them if it becomes possible to do so.\nThey can be useful to fill up some content, but be careful if you do that.

There are some genres which I don\u0026rsquo;t like though.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like dubstep, hardcore, house and other noisy background beats. Don\u0026rsquo;t confuse this with Classical music, Jazz or other genres. I enjoy those music genres. I usually don\u0026rsquo;t like \u0026ldquo;pop\u0026rdquo; either, but there are exceptions to the rule.\nWhat I do like Nerdcore I enjoy Nerdcore, keep in mind that Nerdcore isn\u0026rsquo;t always hip hop.

Security, Privacy, Lock image By Mohamed Hassan - CC0 licensed.\n You have a right on privacy. Privacy means that you have the control over your personal information.\nYour personal information might be a lot more as you think. It is more as just your name or email. It can include your shopping behavior, the sites which you visit, medical info, full-time access to your microphone and a lot more.\nWhy does privacy matter? Privacy means caring about others Many don\u0026rsquo;t value privacy until they lose it. Caring about other people\u0026rsquo;s privacy means that you respect them.\nPrivacy creates trust. Trust is one of the most important elements of love. In other words share the love and give your users their privacy.\n   Two heart-printed stainless steel padlocks image By Ylanite Koppens - CC0 licensed.\n My biggest reason to care is that I don\u0026rsquo;t find it respectful or ethical to deny the privacy of users. I care about privacy, since I think that others should have it. It is a right after all.\nI have nothing to hide We wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have passwords if no one cared about privacy. In other words, feel free to make all your logins public if you don\u0026rsquo;t care about privacy. Don\u0026rsquo;t actually do this. It asks for trouble.\nPrivacy does not exist Some might says that there is no such thing as privacy nowadays. The thing is, everything is breakable, but you can make it harder. People are less likely to break something which is not easy to break, since it is easier to break the thing which is easier to break.\nTime matters, even for the people who attack other people their systems.\nThey already have all my data Old database data can get removed and you change, so the info which they have might be irrelevant in the future. There is also a chance that some cybercriminals remove all that data. The GDPR law (Europe only) is also a thing now, so you have the right to be forgotten.\nShouldn\u0026rsquo;t you try to give others their privacy, even if they have your data? Supporting privacy tools makes them better. It makes life easier for the people who need privacy.\nNot everyone is aware of privacy The sad truth is that many companies spy on users, so that they can sell your personal data to others. Not only companies do this, some cybercriminals also post personal information which they find online.\nEven your friends might share your personal data without being aware of it. Privacy usually requires small sacrifices, not everyone has the guts to make them. Convenience is extremely useful and making every sacrifice is almost, if not completely impossible.\nYour choices are not everyone\u0026rsquo;s choices. A bit better is already a step in the right direction. Not everyone has to be an extreme privacy geek.\nBasic tips Remove things which you no longer use This means that attackers have fewer things to attack, which makes the chance on an attack smaller.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t trust everyone Avoid websites which you don\u0026rsquo;t trust. Some dangerous websites are very good at pretending that they are not dangerous. Don\u0026rsquo;t download or trust every random thing that you read on the internet.\nPasswords  Use a password or any other form of security (PIN, fingerprint,\u0026hellip;) on every device. Use strong passwords and use a different password for every website.  I highly recommend KeepassXC (GPLv2 licensed) which is a password database. It generates all your passwords for you. You only have to remember one password so using it is very convenient.\nBitwarden (GPLv3 licensed) is another option if you prefer an online password database, but remember that online databases can get attacked by other people. You don\u0026rsquo;t have full-control over this.\nUse encryption Encryption is another layer of security. It is not bad to make everything a little bit more secure. I don\u0026rsquo;t use encryption on all my stuff, but I use it on much stuff. The disadvantage of encryption is that it can make your system a bit slower.\nYou can compare it to using a secret code to talk to someone. The other person has to know and decode the code to get the result. Encryption is that secret code.\nYour system will have to do some math before it can access some file, since the file is not readable without decoding the secret code.\n \u0026quot; Number six, any logged clear text, forget it! Encrypt all your data, take those bytes off the record! \u0026quot;\n\u0026ndash; Dual Core (0x0A Hack Commandments)\n Decide how far you want to go Your online information can be used against you. Know what you post, and know that people might use it against you.\nDecide how far you are willing to go for privacy. You can make your own choices. The privacy road is not always convenient. I recommend to at least try to understand why people care about privacy.\nYou might care more when something bad happens with your personal data. I hope that it does not, but it is better to be prepared.\nSoftware types The most popular types of software There are many types of software and knowing a bit about these can learn you that you should or shouldn\u0026rsquo;t trust something.\nThis part of the article is about the different licenses that there are. These aren\u0026rsquo;t all the licenses. I tried to keep it simple and readable.\nClosed source software Close source, also know as proprietary software means that no one can read the code.\nYou might think that it helps for privacy, but it is actually the opposite. One line of code is enough to spy on people. More eyes on the code means that people find and fix the problems.\nThe method of encryption can be known, but those functions are so strong that most people don\u0026rsquo;t understand it and good methods are not easy to break. Some methods haven\u0026rsquo;t been broken yet. People who are great at math write those complex methods.\nOpen source software Open source means that the source, in other words the code is readable for everyone. This is great, but many open source things also have downsides.\nOpen washing is a thing. That means promoting a product like everything is open, but it actually still contains closed source code. Companies like to do it.\nPublic domain software Public domain software is open source and has no restrictions, so anyone can steal the code and sell it. This can be good, but keep in mind that anyone can steal your code.\nNo restrictions means that you can use it for any purpose. It is pretty awesome to see when a tool uses the public domain license (CC0).\nFree software Free or libre software is open source, but it has a different goal as open source software. The goal is to give the users of the program freedom.\nKeep in mind that many people prefer that you don\u0026rsquo;t call it open source. The goal is different, and some people find this goal better as the one which open source has.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t mean free as in gratis. This is a bit confusing some times. It is free as in freedom. People some times use the word libre to avoid this confusion. In other words, yes you can ask money for free software licensed things.\nPeople can steal your code like public domain software, but only if they license it as free software.\nLibre software has to respect four freedoms. This can make it a better option as open source if you care about privacy.\nEmail Email providers Many mail providers are closed source software which is why you probably should not trust them. There are not many email providers which are focused on privacy.\n Tutanota (GPLv3 licensed) Protonmail (MIT licensed) Cock.li - A server which is hosted by one person instead of a company. Use this at your own risk. Many sites block mailaddresses of this provider. Selfhost your email. This is meant for the people who have time and can afford it. It is definitely not always the easiest route.  Email clients There are a lot of clients which I could mention here. I personally just use my browser to check my email.\nClaws mail, Evolution, Mutt (terminal only),\u0026hellip;\nThe reason that I probably would not recommend the popular Mozilla Thunderbird client is that it is not GPL licensed. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that it uses a bad license, but there are GPL licensed alternatives.\nPGP PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is something which you can use to encrypt your emails. It works with a web of trust.\nI use Tutanota, so I use the method of encryption which they provide. I don\u0026rsquo;t often encrypt my emails, but I try to think what I send through email.\nEmail is not secure, never send passwords through email.\nSocial media It is actually pretty funny that social media is in this list. People can find a ton of personal information on social media. You could try to stop using the most social media when you are a privacy fan.\nThe most popular social media services are known for not caring about privacy. Don\u0026rsquo;t put everything publicly on social media, since it is free information for data mining and cybercriminals. I also recommend removing your old posts. Information can be used against you.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t trust that something is private on social media. They usually sell your personal data.\nThe Fediverse The most popular social media network which isn\u0026rsquo;t know for mining your personal data is probably the Fediverse.\nIt can do a lot, including video hosting (like YouTube) and image hosting (like Instagram). The possibilities of this network are huge.\n  Fediverse logo By Eukombos - CC0 licensed.\n Fediverse things work with a thing called instances. You will have to pick an instance when you want to join it. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry though. You can still talk to other instances and it is not unusual to switch instance after a few months.\nSome instances use Cloudflare. Cloudflare does not care about your privacy. I highly recommend to read my Cloudflare article if you aren\u0026rsquo;t aware of these problems.\n Similar to Twitter: Mastodon and Pleroma Similar to Facebook: Diaspora (Does not use the Fediverse) Similar to YouTube: PeerTube Similar to Instagram: Pixelfed  PeerTube does not have as much content as YouTube, but you can use Invidious if the videos which you like aren\u0026rsquo;t on PeerTube. Invidious has the same videos as YouTube.\nKeep in mind that the Fediverse still has some problems. The way that it works is far from perfect.\nChat applications IRC and XMPP are probably some of the better ones for privacy. Keep in mind that public IRC servers usually keep logs.\nBe careful with what you say. Information can be used against you.\n \u0026quot; Number three, never trust nobody! IRC is bad luck when you chat too much. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ndash; Dual Core (0x0A Hack Commandments)\n I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend Matrix or Discord. They both use Cloudflare. Matrix can be selfhosted to solve the problem, but the official servers use Cloudflare, so you will indirectly tell others to keep using Cloudflare.\nBrowsers Support competition People compare a lot of browsers, but the privacy problems might be deeper. I think that there just isn\u0026rsquo;t enough competition.\nChromium based browsers have a lot of the browser market. I would avoid them. Support competition instead.\nI do have browser engine idea. Feel free to check it out, if you also think that the currently browsers lack some privacy features and other features.\nTor browser The Tor browser is one of the better privacy focused browsers out there, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t use it for everything. It a bit slow. It isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect either security wise, but it is better as many of the other options.\n \u0026quot; Don\u0026rsquo;t bet your future on just a few tools. Even .onion sites can have leaks too. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ndash; Dual Core (0x0A Hack Commandments)\n Abrowser I use a browser, no really I use Abrowser. It is like GNU Icecat, but without the default extensions. The default extensions of GNU Icecat are a bit too much for me.\nI think that GNU LibreJS will never work in practice unless some law forces people to license their JavaScript in a GNU LibreJS way. It kinda misses the point. The idea is not bad, but it just does not work currently.\nFirefox and Chromium problems Mozilla Firefox uses Cloudflare for DNS, by default unless you use an older Firefox version. Chromium tracks you a lot, since it is from Google.\nGoogle also does some great things for the community, but remember that they are an advertising company. They make the many of their money from their closed source advertising service, AdWords.\nTracking users helps them with recommending more personal advertisements, which might increase the amount of clicks on the ads.\nMozilla also did some good things for the community. I would pick Firefox over Chromium if I had to choose. Just know that both browsers have some privacy problems by defaul\nWeb browsing tips Basic tips Many browsers show the location of a link in the left bottom if you place your mouse on top of the link.\nSome websites have malware on them. Don\u0026rsquo;t trust a site which has a ton of download buttons or a ton of ads and such. Just use your common sense and check if the site can be trusted.\nKnow what the attackers do Some people are very good at hiding malware or/and stealing your personal information. It isn\u0026rsquo;t bad to take a look at the things which cybercriminals try to do.\nPhishing is a thing that many still fall for. You can easily learn yourself how to detect many phishing attacks. Phishing is when an attacker sends you an email or something else which is supposed to look innocent, but it is harmful.\nDefending yourself against attackers is a whole topic, so I suggest that you do your own research on the basics of defending yourself.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t accept cookies Cookies are small files which contain a bit of data. This data can be used to keep your preferences like the language and/or website theme you prefer.\nThose harmless cookies aren\u0026rsquo;t the real problem. The real problems are the tracking cookies. Those cookies can store your behavior and other personal browsing data.\nThey might contain any of the following information:\n The links you click while using the website The amount of time you spend on a website The pages which you visit (a bit like your browsing history) Much more tracking data  The Europe GDPR law contains something so that people can\u0026rsquo;t collect personal data through cookies unless they have your permission. This is one of the reasons why you might see cookies pop-ups on websites. You can decline cookies and I recommend you to do so.\nFingerprinting It is true that extensions make your browser fingerprint more unique if they interact with more as the browser UI.\nEvery browser has a fingerprint which can be used to track you. It is not easy to do something about this even the way in which you type defines a bit of your browser fingerprint.\nCompletely getting rid of a unique fingerprint can be impossible. There is always something which makes it unique unless you use the defaults of a browser. This is also why the Tor browser is pretty secure. Many people use it with the default settings.\nYou can defend yourself against the most common fingerprinting techniques. A canvas blocker add-on tries to defend you against fingerprinting attacks which are caused by the HTML5 canvas element.\nI personally think that add-ons at least protect you from other dangers, so I think that you should use them. I have a page with add-ons which I recommend.\nWorld maps OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a service similar to Google maps.\nSearch engines Many browsers come with Google as the default search engine, but keep in mind that Google is an advertising company. They have to do tracking to make more money.\nSome alternatives are startpage (couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the license) and searx (AGPL licensed). I switch search engine from time to time. I have used the above search engines, but it is not easy to pick one.\nYaCy looks like a great option, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t tried it.\nMost search engines are proprietary. Proprietary search engines: Bing, Qwant, DuckDuckGo (the core of DuckDuckGo is proprietary),\u0026hellip;\nOther recommendations Phones Avoid phones or use a ROM like LineageOS and F-Droid as the app store if you need a phone. This might change in the future, the Librem 5 might become a good option.\nOnly use the features which you need when you decide to use a phone.\nPhones collect a ton of personal info. You are the one that chooses your sacrifices though. A phone is an important device for many people.\nOperating systems Windows and OS X are proprietary, so you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t trust them. You can use them and many people depend on some specific tools.\nRemember, it is a choice. You probably won\u0026rsquo;t convince someone to use something if you push them too hard. They can ask you questions about your system if they are interested.\nThe GNU+Linux and BSD operating systems are the alternatives to those operating systems. I would recommend Debian or Devuan for beginners. You can try those operating systems in a virtual machine.\nI am not going to lie, these operating systems require some learning, but it is not that hard.\nOther options QubesOS looks security focused, but it looks resource heavy. I also really like what GuixSD is doing.\nYou can use a free (as in freedom) distro, but you have to be sure that you have drivers for everything. I want to recommend this to everyone, but the privacy sacrifice is too big for most people.\nKeep learning Look at the privacy focused movements, and don\u0026rsquo;t trust everything blindly. Some of these movements are the FSF, the EFF, defective by design,\u0026hellip;\nI could write more about this, but I wanted to stick to the basics. Feel free to contact me if you think that I missed something important. I have more articles which talk about privacy.

I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure of recycling worked a while ago. It seems like most recycling does not work.\nRecycling really seems uneffective when you think about it. The garbage gets moved which costs fuel and energy is needed to process it. How can that even help and what happens?\n  The recycling symbol By Krdan Ielalir - CC0 licensed.\n The recycling which works is usually recycling which you get money for. Most recycling is a lie. It is sad, but there are still things which we can do. It is a wonder that many people believe that all recycling helps.\nI am not saying that you should not recycle. The garbage has to go somewhere and it is better for the enviroment if not everyone has to drive to some place with a ton of garbage.\nPenn \u0026amp; Teller: Bullshit! has an episode which shows how recycling worked. You can find it on BitChute. BitChute uses Cloudflare. I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend it, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find another source.\nKeep in mind that this problem is different for every country. There are things which do work. I just don\u0026rsquo;t find it ethical to spread lies.\nWhat can we do? Is there a solution? It will take a long time before an solution can be created. I think that it is possible, but it is difficult. We can at least care about the problem and work on it.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t have kids More people means more people who create garbage. You might not like this, but not having kids helps. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to follow this advice, and I understand that some people like kids.\nUse less Some people call using less, minimalism. I like that, but not everyone means the same when they use the word.\nI mean buying things or making decisions based on what you need instead of what you want with minimalism. It is a state of mind. This does not mean that you can\u0026rsquo;t have pictures and memories. You can do it in a extreme way, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to.\nMinimalism has other advantages as well. You can find things faster, since you have less stuff to look through. Less stuff means more money. Less stuff means less garbage.\nMinimalism does not mean that you give up all convenient things. You can take it that far, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to.\nTake care of your stuff Your stuff should last longer when you are more careful with it. Looking at which product is the best option also helps, since it might last longer as other products.\nUse things which last longer Compare a plastic water bottle and a glass water bottle for example. You can refill the bottles, but people often throw the small plastic bottles away. Those bottles become garbage. The glass bottle does not, unless someone breaks it.\nPlastic bottles might last long for you. This is just an example to show what I mean.\nSpread the word Tell people about the problems and explain why they should care.

I don\u0026rsquo;t like systemd, but the AUR has so many packages. The good sides are greater as the bad sides for me. I have been a long time Debian-based distro user and I like stability. I also like up to date packages though.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have installation scripts for my current configuration for Arch. I have that for Devuan. I might create that one day, but it costs time.\nRolling is not stable    Arch xorg.conf broke. It is probably public domain licensed, since it is one of those internet jokes - CC0 licensed.\n People often say that rolling is not stable. There is some truth in that, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t had any problems with that yet. I actually find it more stable. Probably because I used some specific things like virtualbox repositories and custom builded packages like Emacs on Devuan.\nI recommend to keep the system minimal. Having many packages causes that you have a higher chance on problems with broken packages.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like systemd I disabled many default systemd services which I don\u0026rsquo;t need. I find that systemd does too much. It also broke my networking service. I had to install the dhclient package even though I already had dhcpcd. That fixed my networking problems. My network manager, wicd worked perfectly fine on Devuan.\nI know that Artix (Arch without systemd) exists. The problem is compatibility with the AUR. Most packages expect that you have systemd. It is better to just use systemd to avoid package conflicts with the AUR.\nThe Arch Way I often don\u0026rsquo;t recommend to install Arch \u0026ldquo;The Arch Way\u0026rdquo;. People want convenience. Using the commandline to install your distro can be great, but it often costs people valuable time. Most people won\u0026rsquo;t need most commands which you use during the install.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong installing it through the commandline can be fast and has advantages. Many Arch users say taht you should only use Arch if you do the commandline install. I don\u0026rsquo;t agree.\nDoing it to learn the commands is understandable, but I would recommend to try Linux From Scratch in a virtual machine instead if you want to learn much.\nArch installers Arch Zen Installer The Zen Installer provides a full graphical (point and click) environment for installing Arch Linux. It can even detect and install the video drivers which you need. You don\u0026rsquo;t have as much options as archfi, but you can install the needed packages after your basic Arch install.\n Gitlab \n Archfi A bash installer which you can run after booting into the Arch ISO. You don\u0026rsquo;t have as much options as installing Arch \u0026ldquo;The Arch Way\u0026rdquo;, but you can install the needed packages after your basic Arch install.

GPL, the good parts   Free Software Foundation - CC0 licensed.\n The GPL license tries to give you the four freedoms. This makes it a bit more trustable as other licenses.\n The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0). The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is needed for this. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2). The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others ( freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a needed for this.  That is all great, but the license has some things which you should think about\nThe GPL attempts to force people to release their source code It would be great if this would actually work.\nThink about it for a minute. What would a closed source company do?\nThey would use the code and not tell anybody or in the other case write code from scratch. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that that first option would benefit anyone. The code would stay secret and improvements will not help the project.\nConsider the same project under another license like MIT or BSD. The company might use the code, but they are more likely to commit changes back. This can lead to a better project.\nThe GPL license isn’t easy to understand The GPL is complex. You are supposed to include a license notice on every file for example. That takes some effort. You can find many incorrectly GPL licensed projects online.\nYou have to re-release programs under the GPL license The GPL forces you to release anything which uses the source code of the program under the GPL license. This means that closed source companies can’t build a closed source version or new program based on your GPL licensed software.\nMy opinion about the GPL I think that people who use the GPL usually have good intentions. I do like, use and trust many GPL licensed software.\nI believe that you shouldn’t trust licenses. Look at what others think of the software and check the history of the software. The GPL license makes a program more trustable, but it is still a license. Licenses can be violated. The idea of the GPL is not bad, but it is different in practice.\nI do prefer programs which have readable code because people can read the code and make it better. Closed source can be bad, but you never trully know.\n\nWhat if they never do anything bad with the code or your personal data?\nDoes your online privacy even matter? You can find more about this in my How important is online privacy? article.\nWhich licenses should you use? That totally depends. I don’t think that the GPL is bad. It just requires some effort to implement. I think that it is great for privacy and trust. The GPL can be a good choice, but please think before you use it.\nI think that BSD, MIT, CC0,\u0026hellip; are better licenses if you want to be good for people. Keep in mind that everything can have a bad side. CC0 also know as public domain means that anyone can steal your program. It has no restrictions.\nYou should do some research on the different licenses before you pick one. Make sure to think enough about it. Licenses can have consequences.\n","permalink":"https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/think-before-using-the-gpl-license/","tags":["Free-software","Privacy"],"title":"Think before using the GPL license"},{"categories":["about"],"contents":" Table of Contents  Weird keyboard layout Why would anyone use this layout? Security World\u0026rsquo;s fastest typist Possible Dvorak problems ErgoDox EZ    Weird keyboard layout The keyboard layout which I use is the Dvorak layout. People have taken a picture of my keyboard and posted it on 9gag. They did this without asking because it looks weird. Yes, I know 9gag\u0026hellip; a closed source website which contains internet jokes.\nWhy would anyone use this layout?    Picture of the Dvorak layout - CC0 licensed.\n Well, look at it like this. We use QWERTY since people created that for typewriters so people knew the layout already. A typewriter needed a special layout like QWERTY since typewriters work with metal arms and those could jam.\nPeople created the Dvorak layout to replace QWERTY. That layout claims to require less finger movement which is also why many people claim that your typing speed increases when you use Dvorak. I find the Dvorak layout very comfortable to type on. I don\u0026rsquo;t use it to improve my typing speed. I do touch type though.\nSecurity Not everyone knows how to type on a Dvorak keyboard layout. This means that some cybercriminals also don\u0026rsquo;t know the layout. It is not a lot of extra security, but everything that helps, helps.\nWorld\u0026rsquo;s fastest typist The world\u0026rsquo;s current fastest typist is Barbara Blackburn. She broke the world record by using a Dvorak keyboard.\nPossible Dvorak problems Many people who use Dvorak (including me) forget how to type on their other keyboard layout (QWERTY for example).\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t always a problem. I recommend to get a external keyboard which can emulate Dvorak and QWERTY. It makes life easier for your colleagues and also for you when you have to work on other people their machines.\nErgoDox EZ I am a proud owner of an ErgoDox EZ keyboard. It is expensive, but it is worth it. The only problem that I have with this keyboard is that I love it too much. Typing on a non-ergonomic keyboard like the keyboard which my laptop has is not as comfortable. I also miss my keyboard shortcuts and layers on other keyboards.\nThe ErgoDox EZ keyboard can emulate other layouts so I can emulate QWERTY. This is very useful when I have to use a virtual machine. Some virtual machines are preconfigured with the QWERTY layout. I can use this keyboard to emulate QWERTY so that I can easily change the default keyboard layout of the virtual machine to Dvorak.\nKeep in mind that the ErgoDox is not perfect. The thumb keys are not easy to press. I recommend the kinesis keyboard if you do want great thumb keys. They are a bit better. Still not perfect, but better reachable. Xah Lee has written a lot of stuff about keyboards. I recommend to read his keyboard guide or/and to watch his videos.\n","permalink":"https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/my-keyboard/","tags":["Keyboards"],"title":"My keyboard"},{"categories":["reviews"],"contents":" Table of Contents  Back to the Future franchise    Back to the Future franchise It is about a scientist and and teenager who travel back in time.

What is the most important thing about privacy Seek balance Are there any good security related tools? Conclusion    Does privacy matter? Yes, privacy matters for some reasons, but how much should we care?\nWhat is the most important thing about privacy The most important thing about online privacy is probably security. The problem is that it often hurts convenience. It is often just not worth it and you can\u0026rsquo;t always fight against it.\nCloudflare for example, is hard to fight against. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that it is worth it. I used to care a ton about privacy, until I started thinking about the time it takes. You almost have to use unethical things like Cloudflare, so many things depend on it.\nIt feels like online privacy does not exist. Keep in mind that security does exist. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to give your passwords to attackers.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t fight against everything without missing out on important things. Phones save every move you make. Websearch \u0026ldquo;Snowden phones\u0026rdquo; if you don\u0026rsquo;t believe me. Google and other big companies also play with your personal data.\nSeek balance Make hard for the attackers, but not too hard. Not too hard still means that your security should be better than average.\nThere are enough people who are less secure as you. Attackers will pick those victims unless you are a very important person.\nFighting for privacy often takes away a lot of your convenience. You might be more productive without caring about all those things. I think that you should often pick productivity over security.\nThis does not mean that is ethical to take away the privacy of others. I find that a nasty and unjust move. I respect people who fight for privacy and I believe that everyone needs privacy.\nIt is just sad that so many things are being controlled. I hope that GNUnet fixes some of the damage that has been done to the internet.\nAre there any good security related tools? I do recommend things like password databases, just because it makes your life even more convenient and more secure. It is worth it. It is ok to choose security sometimes, but don\u0026rsquo;t let it ruin your life.\nIt is not bad to know how you can protect yourself, but also ask yourself of it is worth it. Security and privacy matters, but so does convenience and productivity.\nOne basic rule is think before you post something on the internet. This alone, can help you a lot. People can use your data against you.\nConclusion Choose how far you are willing to go, but don\u0026rsquo;t become too obsessed with it. Security and privacy matters, but so does convenience and productivity.\n","permalink":"https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/how-important-is-online-privacy/","tags":["Free-software","Privacy"],"title":"How important is online privacy?"},{"categories":["about"],"contents":"You can find my GNU Emacs config on Codeberg.

Linux is the most used kernel and GNU is a common set of tools.\nWhy GNU+Linux is not the correct word Systems with BusyBox instead of GNU, systems which use the GNU Hurd kernel and many other systems exist.

I like the GNU tools, so I also use that word if I have to pick one of the those two words.\nLinux is what people know. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that it is bad to use that word.

I usually use the distro name when I talk about a system. I use the word GNU+Linux as well.\nThe distro name might be the clearest thing that you can use.

You can find it in the AUR if you use Arch. I am not sure of it exists in the repositories of other distros.\nkanshi kanshi is a tool which automatically sets your display configuration when you connect or disconnect a display. It works like autorandr. You can find it in the community repository on Arch.\nA example of ~/.config/kanshi/config could look like this:\n# When the displays eDP-1 and DP-4 are connected. { # Left display (look at position, wdisplays can make this easier) output eDP-1 mode 1920x1080@60.052Hz position 0,0 scale 1 # Right display output DP-4 mode 1920x1080@60Hz position 1920,0 scale 1 } # When only the display eDP-1 is connected. { output eDP-1 mode 1920x1080@60.052Hz position 0,0 scale 1 } You will have to run the kanshi command to run it.\nTaking screenshots You will need grim and slurp to take screenshots. I also recommend wl-clipboard, so that you can copy the screenshot to your clipboard.\n# Take a screenshot, save it and copy it to your clipboard grim -g \u0026#34;$(slurp)\u0026#34; ~/screen.png | wl-copy Other things Most other things should just work. You can run Xorg applications in Wayland.\nYou should look into the keyboard configuration. It is different depending on which desktop environment or window manager you pick.\nSome drivers and keyboard configuration settings are not supported yet. You might want to read: Why I no longer use Wayland\nSway I use Sway and decided to place a configuration for it here. Sway claims that your current i3 configuration should work.

It is not installed by default.\ni3status is the statusbar which I use. That is why I still have i3 installed.
