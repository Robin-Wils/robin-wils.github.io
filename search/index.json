The Unix philosophy does not exist  Let\u0026rsquo;s think a bit To make it more complicated   Words which you can use instead  Those words are not perfect either   Conclusion Other interesting links Related article  \r\rGNU\u0026rsquo;s Not Unix, Emacs is Unix This article is going to make some people angry, but please read it first before you complain.\nUnix GNU by design does not include Unix code, but what is Unix?\nUnix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the \u0026ldquo;Unix philosophy\u0026rdquo;.\nThis \u0026ldquo;philosophy\u0026rdquo; was made by AT\u0026amp;T, a closed source company. It was invented by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and others.\nThe Unix philosophy The rules of this philosophy have changed over the years, but most definitions include that it only must do one thing well, and only that one thing.\nWhy is GNU Emacs, Unix then? Well, I just want to make it clear that the Unix philosophy is very vague. What is \u0026ldquo;one thing\u0026rdquo;?\nThey sometimes say that it is one responsibility.\nGNU Emacs can be looked at like it has one responsibility, interpreting elisp code. So you could call it Unix.\nDamn, you could even call the Windows Operating System Unix. It does one thing. It does computing (in other words, it is an Operating System).\nSystemd also has one responsibility, being the init system.\nAll these mentioned tools can do more things, but they can be seen as a part of that bigger responsibility.\nThe Unix philosophy does not exist You might think that things can\u0026rsquo;t have such big responsibilities, only small ones like text editing.\nVim only does one thing, which is text editing right? Well what about highlighting the syntax of code? It does that too.\nShouldn\u0026rsquo;t it use a separate program that does that?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s think a bit You should have a separate program for every key on your keyboard if you think like that.\nThe \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; key is only responsible for one thing and that is showing \u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; when you press it.\nThe \u0026ldquo;b\u0026rdquo; key is responsible for a different specific thing, which is showing \u0026ldquo;b\u0026rdquo; when you press it.\nDo you get what I mean? The unix philosophy never really existed, because the definition is incomplete and vague.\nI get the point, it is sometimes good that your program does not do too much and that it uses programs which already exist, but Unix is just vague and unclear.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t hate that way of thinking, and believe that parts of it are good, but like everything. Don\u0026rsquo;t follow any vague principle like a religion.\nMost if not all of these design principles are designed by business people. It are buzzwords and you can\u0026rsquo;t use them right or wrong. It are guidelines.\nTo make it more complicated (This section was added after I received some comments on the Fediverse)\nTrademark Unix is also a trademark. So what is Unix? You could say that it is just a trademark.\nThat is not what people mean when they say things like: \u0026ldquo;This program is Unix\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;This program is great because it is Unix\u0026rdquo;.\nAnyway, this is about that thing. What makes a program Unix? What is the Unix philosophy?\nPOSIX There is this other thing that you sometimes hear. \u0026ldquo;It does not have to be POSIX to be Unix.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are many things which people call Unix, which are not POSIX. POSIX is just a standard which you could use.\nVim is not even completely POSIX compliant. It is mostly compliant, but people still call it Unix.\nMacOS is mostly compliant according to some, but many people don\u0026rsquo;t like to call it Unix. Some call it Unix though.\nWords which you can use instead Some people like to say that a program is something. Saying that a program is Unix, does not really describe what you mean in my opinion.\nWords like modular, minimal and composable sound less like meaningless buzzwords in my opinion. They actually describe what you mean.\nThose words are not perfect either They are not perfect, just like the word \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo;. What is \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo;? What is \u0026ldquo;minimal\u0026rdquo;?\nThese words have to do with what you think, but they at least sound less like a buzzword.\nBuzzwords usually are just used to promote stuff and such. Many people don\u0026rsquo;t know what they actually mean, or if it even has meaning.\nConclusion So what Unix is\u0026hellip;, is just a buzzword, a design principle. It is also a trademark.\nYou can follow it, but there is no right or wrong way to apply it.\nIt means multiple things, but this was mostly written to prevent people from yelling that some program is Unix, and some other program is not.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t hate a program because \u0026ldquo;it is not Unix\u0026rdquo;. Don\u0026rsquo;t call any program \u0026ldquo;Unix\u0026rdquo;. It is not some standard. It are guidelines.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t follow any design principle like a religion. It are guidelines, not rules. There is no right or wrong way to do something in design principles.\nPeople like to pretend that some design principles are holy, but they are not. It are guidelines, and it is not something which prevents mistakes and only creates \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; code.\nOther interesting links \r\rFast Food the UNIX way - Xah Lee\r\r(also check the \"see also\" link)\r\r\rThe Collapse of the UNIX Philosophy - Askar Safin\r\r\r\rRelated article \r\rThe programming culture has problems\r\r\r","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/technology/gnu-emacs-is-unix/","tags":["GNU-Emacs","Thoughts","Technology"],"title":"GNU Emacs is Unix"},{"categories":["thoughts"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r I have no friends Explain yourself, please! To be clear Thanks for reading  \r\rI have no friends I have no friends, well according to how I think about the word friend. People change constantly, and it is pretty much impossible to completely agree with every opinion from someone.\nExplain yourself, please! I think of people like connections. They have good and bad things about them.\nHere is an extreme example, a murderer can have done good things. It isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad connection if you speak with that person about those good things. You can\u0026rsquo;t know everything about someone, and likely wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know of they are a murderer.\nTrust is a weird thing, which can break quickly, but I try to not have any enemies. People usually have something good about them. I support ideas, not people.\nIn other words, I try to have no friends or enemies. This method of thinking has flaws. We are human, so have emotions. There wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be love without hate. There wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be good without evil.\nTo be clear I can support someone somewhere, but I would look at it differently. I support that person for specific ideas in that case.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t love or enjoy hate and evil. Hate and evil, can\u0026rsquo;t be gone. It makes us human. Different cultures have different thoughts, that makes some cultures evil in the eyes of some other cultures.\nYou can build trust with me. Trust is a human thing. Every person has flaws. I would open my door to what some would call enemies. People can change, but it is ok to be careful from time to time.\nIt is also good to look at how the people which you don\u0026rsquo;t like think. Look into the ideas of people, and you will be surprised.\nThanks for reading Thanks for reading this.\nYou might understand me a bit more now. I know, I am someone which many would call weird.\nAt least I am honest, and being different makes you unique, so you stand out. Not everything weird is good though.\nI am thinking of converting my articles to videos some day.

This command will have some parameters which will help you with configuring dwm.\nYou can also think about this project for another program. This came to my mind, since many packages of the suckless project aren\u0026rsquo;t that user friendly to install. This can make one of their packages more user friendly to configure.\nuseful-wiki The purpose of this project is to help people with finding the right wiki\u0026rsquo;s quickly.\nCloud Firewall You might have heard of the Cloud Firewall browser extension. The idea is to make the same thing, but as a actual application which runs on your desktop. Firewall blocking by using the Firewall of the system should work better than an add-on which does it by rDNS requests.\nBetter browser engine A browser engine is the core of every web browser. It is the part of the browser which renders your pages.\nThe idea is to create a browser engine with editable options. These options should make it possible to create different configurations.\nSome configurations could focus on privacy while others could focus on a browser with many features for average users.\nWhy? The browser engine market is rather small, but I hear many people complaining that they can\u0026rsquo;t do some things in their browser.\nSome wanted features are:\n Keybindings (Vi and GNU Emacs ones for example) Better control over security settings Default external link configuration (configuration options could be: new tab, new window or default) \u0026hellip;  How can you achieve extendibility? I was thinking of doing this by creating different packages. The basic browser engine should already contain some by default though. A bit like how repositories work. The system which GNU Emacs uses as well.\nModern new editor GNU Emacs does not use code parsers to do the syntax highlighting or at least not by default. The way that it does syntax highlighting is by regular expressions. This can cause incorrect syntax highlighting.\nVi-like things are even worse, since they can\u0026rsquo;t even handle multiple language syntax highlighting in one file.\nI find the way in which GNU Emacs handles packages great, but the editor is becoming more outdated. It works with repositories. The defaults of GNU Emacs aren\u0026rsquo;t great either. I think that parsers or not should be a choice.\nI would like keybindings like Xah Lee has, since he has invested a lot of time in keyboards. Vi and Emacs keybindings are not good when it comes to working for a long time. I do think that keybindings should be a thing which is easily changable.\nI do want a configurable config, just like the GNU Emacs one. It should be lightweight and easy to install. I do want it to be a tiny bit more modern. Some packages could be a bit more heavy, but lightweight alternatives should exist.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/projects/ideas/","tags":null,"title":"Ideas"},{"categories":["events"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r What is this \u0026ldquo;challenge\u0026rdquo;?

The Linux Challenge was a challenge in which questions about the common commands on GNU and/or Linux systems must be answered within the time.\nIt was mostly about knowing the standard coreutils of the GNU project, so more a GNU challenge as a Linux one. There weren\u0026rsquo;t any question about the Linux kernel.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think that anyone has the possibility to know everything about the Linux kernel or all the GNU utils.\nThe finals were in Belgium, so it was mainly meant for people from Belgium, but other people could participate as well.\nI wanted to give this a try, since I use GNU+Linux system. I use it daily, but this does not necessarily mean that I really know GNU or Linux.\n  \rThe student winners of the Linux Challenge 2019 standing next to each other - I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the license, but I am pretty sure that I can use this.\n\rI am the person on the right, with the beard. I finished second of all the students.\nThe questions The questions were pretty doable in my opinion, but I am not going to say that luck isn\u0026rsquo;t a factor. They mentioned that the scores were pretty high in general, so the ones who did not win should be proud as well.\nMost questions went pretty smoothly, but not all did. I found the way in which the challenge was done, pretty good and comfortable.\nSome feelings I felt a bit out of my comfort zone when they mentioned my name, since I did not expect it. I am an introvert and was not very social or talkative during the event. My dad drove me to the event and was also watching, which did not really help either. I appreciate the support though.\nI can only blame me for not talking much. It is something that I want to work on. I am probably not the most asocial introvert, but being asocial happens from time to time.\nRed Hat talk about containers There also was a talk from Red Hat about containers. That talk was pretty interesting. It was a good experience overall. It made me think that containers could be a solution. I changed my mind after some research.\nThere are other ways, which are even better. Some people think that containers provide more security from hackers, but this is simply not true and managing containers takes time.\nThe approach of the Guix package manager looks very great. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned in the talk. The Guix package manager fixes many of the current container problems. Containers are usually not reproducable, which is not great for people who care about privacy and security. Guix packs are reproducable.\nGuixSD can even reproduce itself (the current whole system) as a live USB, in a VM or other things. In other words it is very cool.\nIsn\u0026rsquo;t this event closed source? It probably is in some way, but you have to make some decisions. I support free software, but some privacy sacrifices might be worth it.\nDifferent opinions I am not someone who complains about words which I don\u0026rsquo;t agree with. I try to see why others have a different opinion, so that I can learn from that.\nI completely understand why people use the word \u0026ldquo;Linux\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;GNU+Linux\u0026rdquo; or other words. Linux is just an easier word to market and people know the word. This does not mean that I agree with the word. The GNU project deserves credit in my opinion.\nMy opinion about the naming problem: The GNU Linux system naming problem\nIs everyone an hypocrite? Everyone probably depends on some closed source stuff (even if it are just some protocols or bank card stuff). Everyone probably also depends on free software. Everyone is probably a hypocrite.\n \u0026quot; All solutions are hacks. Every opposite is an equal (and if it attracts, look out or you\u0026rsquo;ll make a sequel). Freedom\u0026rsquo;s a right but having any means you\u0026rsquo;re privileged. And our religion of consumerism might have hit a glitch. Clowns are unhappy. Jugglers drop stuff. I display cowardice whenever you talk tough.

Privacy It blocks ads It pays you Donation system   What I don\u0026rsquo;t like about it  \r\rBrave Brave is a FLOSS web browser which includes an ad blocker and gives you free cryptocurrency.\nI know, it sounds like a scam.\n\rDownload Brave \n\rWhy is it good? Privacy It is a step forward in privacy for many people. Most people use Chrome. Brave is based on Chromium and provides some extra security features like using Tor for private windows.\nIt is not as secure as Tor browser and I don\u0026rsquo;t trust Chromium either, but I believe that every browser isn\u0026rsquo;t great for privacy.\nIncluding Tor, even though it is still much better than many other browsers when it comes to privacy.\nIt is not perfect. I2P might be better in many ways, but I haven\u0026rsquo;t looked into it. Not so well-known stuff is sometimes more anonymous, but it can be less secure too.\nThere are so many Firefox based and Chromium based browsers. Most of those browsers don\u0026rsquo;t add many extra features.\nIt blocks ads Brave blocks ads by default, which is neat. The ad blocker is inspired by uBlock Origin and Ghostery.\nThere are still people who don\u0026rsquo;t use an ad blocker. Ad blockers are good for your privacy, since many ads come with trackers. Ads are just annoying. Just block them.\nIt pays you Browsers all kinda suck when it comes to privacy, but Brave does one thing which most other browsers don\u0026rsquo;t do.\nIt pays you, if you allow it to show some small notification like ads in the corner of your screen. This is why I decided to give it a try.\nGo to brave://rewards and make sure that the ads slider is toggled and the auto-contribute slider is not.\nYou have to make an Uphold account to claim the crypto. It isn\u0026rsquo;t the simplest process to go through, but you get a tiny bit of crypto every month. I get around 5 BAT a month from the notification ads.\nYou can get more if you allow donations in Brave Rewards. I configured it. Brave is not a scam and gives you some crypto if you connect an Uphold account.\nUpdate I just realised that you can earn more.\nGo to brave://rewards and click on the tiny settings button which I failed to notice. You can ask Brave to show more ads here, which means more BAT.\n  \rScreenshot of the location of the Brave Rewards settings button By Robin Wils - CC0 licensed.\n\rDonation system Brave comes with a donation system. Brave shows tip buttons on some sites and you can use it to donate to people. This is pretty neat.\nWhat I don\u0026rsquo;t like about it  You need an Uphold account to withdraw the money. Uphold works, but I would like more choice. Uphold does not seem so privacy respecting either. I get why they ask some personal data, but I believe that it is not needed. I like Firefox based stuff more than Chromium based stuff. I love the developer tools of Firefox. I would love some more customisation. It has customisation already, but one thing which I absolulety love about Firefox based browsers is the about:config page.  I would recommend abrowser if you want a Firefox based browser. It is what I currently use to test my websites in.\nUsing Firefox also means supporting competition which is good. Choice is great, but getting free crypto is also welcome.\n\rDownload Brave \n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/technology/brave-browser-is-actually-pretty-alright/","tags":["Technology"],"title":"Brave Browser is actually pretty alright"},{"categories":["thoughts"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r Darkness is beautiful Things which should be more known  The murder of Junko Furuta Child trafficking is a multi-billion industry   Why these things are important  \r\rDarkness is beautiful Extremely horrible things happen in the world, but people try to cover it up. I like the dark side of life and often find it beautiful, mysterious and creative.\nDark things allow things to be beautiful and to change, but there is something which I want to share. These things might change how you think about the world.\nI find it beautiful, because everyone has a different opinion about what evil is. Death is also an interesting topic. There something fascinating about dark things. It also draws our attention by nature.\nThings which should be more known The following things are hard to read, but they are important to talk about. People should know these things. These things are almost not believable, but they are or were real.\nWarning: Reading the following things will probably ruin your day.\nThe murder of Junko Furuta A Japanese girl was murdered very brutally and people just forgot it. She got tortured brutally daily for forthy days. I will spare you the details. The Yakuza (Japanes mafia) was involved.\nMany people knew about the torturing, but nobody reported it. The criminals didn\u0026rsquo;t spend a ton of time in jail and are free now.\nIt is sad to see that the murder didn\u0026rsquo;t bring any changes in the world, some other horrific murder cases did bring some changes. People should talk more about horrible stuff like this, so that it will not be forgotten.\nCinemas Underbelly did a review about the \u0026ldquo;Junko Furuta Exploitation Collection\u0026rdquo;. It includes some more details, but even more info can be found online.\n\rYouTube \n\rChild trafficking is a multi-billion industry Children are kidnapped and used every day.\nThe worst part is that big organisations like the CIA, FBI and big companies like Coca Cola are a part of it. They don\u0026rsquo;t want you to know this.\nBy the way that is not the only horrible thing that those big organisations do, but that discussion is for another time.\n\nThe Madeleine McCann case Take a look at the Madeleine McCann case. The child who went \u0026ldquo;missing\u0026rdquo; was captured by pedophiles.\nYou will find videos like the following video more easily than official videos. This shows us that people do no research after watching the news.\nEdit: The video got taken down, along with many other videos\u0026hellip; Anyway, here is a list of things I remember:\n\nPage 129 of Kate McCann\u0026rsquo;s book\nThe mother of the girl wrote a book called Madeleine which contains the following horrible sentence.\n  She also said that she wanted Madeleine to read it. Isn\u0026rsquo;t that an obvious clue that Madeleine isn\u0026rsquo;t just \u0026ldquo;missing\u0026rdquo;?\n\nPast tense\nThey very often talk about Madeleine in past tense.\nThe parents claimed that she was missing, but their spokesman Clarence Mitchell once slipped over his words and said that Madeleine was death.\nOopsie, he probably wasn\u0026rsquo;t meant to say that. The sniffer dogs also alerted in the apartement and their car. What is the chance that a sniffer dog is incorrect?\n\nMore\nThere is a ton more about this case, but I think think that those two things are enough proof to convince you that there was more going on.\n\nThe Finders MisterMetokur did a long live stream about a group called \u0026ldquo;The Finders\u0026rdquo;. It contains some FBI documents.\nThe video starts at 04:18. The discussion about the topic starts at 06:12. Give it some time. It does not start immediately.\nDisclaimer: I linked to that specfic video. Watch other videos at your own risk.\n\rBitChute \n\r\nAn Open Secret An Open Secret is an documentary film about child sexual abuse in the film industry in California.\nIt includes many stuff about Bryan Singer.\n\rArchive.org  BitChute \n\r\nPeople who tried to expose it People get murdered because they spread information about this.\nAvicii (possibly)\nThe news and media say that he killed himself. This was likely not the case. The “For a Better Day\u0026rdquo; video is obviously about child trafficking.\nHis family claims that he didn\u0026rsquo;t do suicide. There were recent videos of him being happy. This suicide or murder has no proof though.\nTory Smith\nPeople think that Tory Smith got killed because he made videos about information from the organisations and people behind child trafficking.\nWhy these things are important It is important to know about these things.

My experience at FOSDEM Projects that I had not heard of  Sourcehut KDE Itinerary MuseScore   Other projects  GNU/Linux phones Haiku GNUnet Matrix Even more projects    \r\rWhat is FOSDEM?  \rCopyright © FOSDEM - CC BY 2.0 BE licensed. Changes: compressed the image and changed the size of the image.\n\rFOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Belgium in Brussels.\nMy experience at FOSDEM FOSDEM was great, just like last year.\nThere were a lot of interesting talks. I actually met someone from the Fediverse this year. We missed out on meeting an other person who uses the Fediverse, because we just couldn\u0026rsquo;t find each other. Hey, at least I met someone which is cool.\nI met OTheB at FOSDEM. He is developing his own programming language. We had some nice talks.\n\rWebsite\n\r\rMastodon \n\rI didn\u0026rsquo;t talk to many of the stands this year. We saw many talks though. You can\u0026rsquo;t do everything.\nI enjoyed it and would go again. I am not saying that it is for everyone, since it is about free and open software and that might be a bit too nerdy/geeky for some people.\nProjects that I had not heard of Sourcehut Sourcehut is a platform for Git, like Gitlab and Github. The cool thing about Sourcehut is that people don\u0026rsquo;t have to create an account to contribute to projects. It also uses bash scripts, so you can easily make some kind of pipeline.\nIt looks very promising. Honestly, it is possible that Github or Gitlab uses the same idea some day.\nKDE Itinerary KDE Itinerary is a digital traveling assistant focused on protecting your privacy. I think that it is not fully free (as in freedom), but it surely looks great. You no longer need the google API to travel.\nI really recommend to check this one out.\nMuseScore MuseScore is a free and open-source program to create, play and print music sheets. The fun part was when I got home and my sister (who plays violin) said that she knew it and actually used it.\nOther projects GNU/Linux phones The KDE and Pine stands were always packed with people. Those stands had the new GNU/Linux phones. There were some interesting talks about the phones as well.\nI personally am going to wait until more phones have been released. OTheB ordered the Librem5 when they asked for donations. It is cool that these things exist now. I really look forward to getting one, when the time is right.\nHaiku Haiku is an free and open-source operating system based on BeOS. BeOS is an OS from 1995. They had gratis disks with Haiku on it. I managed to get one and installed it on my previous laptop.\nIt really feels like a system from a few years ago. I am not sure what I am going to use it for. It is different than many operating systems, and that is cool in a way. I hope that some software runs on it.\nGNUnet We managed to catch a talk about GNUnet. GNUnet is a new more secure implementation for the internet. It replaces every layer in the OSI model.\nIt was pretty technical, but it was worth it. Some layers of GNUnet are ready to use. They are talking to many other organizations and already have standardized some parts of the new model. GNS which will replace DNS has been through that process already.\nKeep in mind that it will take a few years before you can use it in production environments.\nAnother cool thing is that GNUnet, written in C, can be extended on. It can be done in different languages. So you can basically replace a part in the model with your own code.\nMatrix I have been negative about Matrix before in my Cloudflare article, but lets look at reality. It is getting more popular and is a solution for connecting different messaging systems. I still don\u0026rsquo;t want to use it, but they are doing something cool. I rather avoid Cloudflare on things which I use often.\nEven more projects There were too many projects to mention them all. Nextcloud, Gitlab, Godot and many other unmentioned projects were also there. Most projects at FOSDEM are awesome, so don\u0026rsquo;t think that this list contains all the awesome projects.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/events/fosdem-2020/","tags":null,"title":"FOSDEM 2020"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r What is the difference?

Both words mean that it is a way to share messages or ideas with others, but it are rather vague words. It is hard to give these words a correct meaning, but I gave it a try.\nSocial media is a part of the media nowadays and many people use the media to impact others. It is the best way to reach people.\nSocial media and the media aren\u0026rsquo;t so different. You can only see a bit of the world at the time, in other words, people have an impact on you all the time.\n  \rSocial media binoculars By Glen Carrie - CC0 licensed.\n\rSocial networking and social media I see social media as the full package which includes media and other stuff. Social networking is usually included in this full package.\nI mean the part in which people chat or talk with others when I use the word social networking. Social networking applications are things like IRC, email, videocalls and chatting.\nSome might see these things as social media, but I see it as a different thing.\nResearch shows us Social media Social media is similar to (or is) a drug and can be bad for your health.\n \u0026quot; Around one-third of humans on the planet are using social media, and some of these people are displaying maladaptive, excessive use of these sites. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ndash; Dar Meshi (lead author and assistant professor at MSU)\n \rResearch source: Excessive social media users demonstrate impaired decision making in the Iowa Gambling Task; Year: 2019; Authors: Dar B Meshi and Anastassia Elizarova and Andrew R.

Someone who uses a social networking site might be more likely to avoid serious psychological distress.\n\rResearch source: Social Networking Sites and Addiction: Ten Lessons Learned; Year: 2017; Authors: Daria J. Kuss and Mark D. Griffiths; Published in: International journal of environmental research and public health;\n\rKeep in mind that I don\u0026rsquo;t see social networking as social media. Social networking is a smaller package.\nSocial media disadvantages That research might have shown you, why social media is probably not healthy and addicting, but it has even more disadvantages.\nThere is even a video of the founding president of Facebook who claims that they make it addicting and that they always knew this.\n\rWatch on YouTube\n\r \u0026quot; It’s a social-validation feedback loop\u0026hellip; exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology. \u0026quot;\n\u0026quot; The inventors, creators \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s me, it\u0026rsquo;s Mark, it\u0026rsquo;s Kevin Systrom on Instagram, it\u0026rsquo;s all of these people \u0026ndash; understood this, consciously. And we did it anyway. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ndash; Sean Parker, the founding president of Facebook\n Fake news It usually contains a lot of propaganda and lies. It can contain some truths as well, but many people also believe the lies, since they don\u0026rsquo;t have the time or are too lazy to do some research.\nPeople get paid to promote stuff. Social media is still a marketing tool. The media also has this problem.\nPrivacy problems Many people including kids, probably don\u0026rsquo;t read the extreme policies which you accept by making a social media account.\nSome policies of the popular Facebook network allow them to:\n Use all the information which they receive about you. That includes things which you haven\u0026rsquo;t done yet. Nothing you do on Facebook is private. (This gives them permission to constantly spy on you); Collect information about things which you do after you leave their website; Use your identity, even in ads; Give your data to partners. Partners can mean a lot;  Keep in mind that this isn\u0026rsquo;t even everything. I recommend the \u0026ldquo;Terms of Service; Didn’t Read\u0026rdquo; add-on if you want to see the Words of Service in a more readable format.\nTerms of Service; Didn\u0026rsquo;t Read This extension informs you instantly of your rights online by showing an unintrusive icon in the toolbar. You can click on this icon to get summaries from the Terms of Service; Didn\u0026rsquo;t Read initiative.\nLicense: AGPLv3\n\rWebsite  Github \n\r\rFirefox  Chromium  Opera  Safari \n\rIt costs you time Your time is valuable. Life’s short. Don\u0026rsquo;t let social media eat your time, many people don\u0026rsquo;t realize how much time social media really takes. Not much (if even anything) is worth living a life that you wouldn’t like. Nothing is worth putting aside what you have always wanted to be.\nGood reasons to use social media Is using it to stay in contact with others any good? Using it to have contact with others is a good reason in my opinion.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t let privacy ruin your life. Try to often avoid the social media part of the platform in that case. You are the exception and will lose connections if you leave such a platform.\nSome of your connections which know something about computers will try to stay in touch in some way, but you might discover that you don\u0026rsquo;t have much connections which you can trust.\nSocial media is not going away soon. It is important to know your limit if you decide to use that poison. Test what it does to you if you spend a few weeks without social media.\nI feel better in general when I stop using social media for a while. Do what feels right in the long run and play with the options.\nTo influence people This is a very good reason to use social media. Influencing people is useful when you try to sell a product or an idea.\nIt is just the fastest and easiest way to market something. Many people use it and it works. There are other ways though. I add share links, so that I don\u0026rsquo;t have to have an account on those platforms.\nMy share links don\u0026rsquo;t use any tracking JavaScript, since I don\u0026rsquo;t find it ethical to track users.\nShare buttons The Facebook like buttons violate the GDPR and I bet that it isn\u0026rsquo;t the only social media button which tracks everything you do, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a Facebook account. This is a reason why some people like myself often block JavaScript.\nI added custom share links for these platforms. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I won\u0026rsquo;t use the buttons which these platforms provide. I cares about your privacy. It is just a way to get my content to the people who aren\u0026rsquo;t aware of these problems.\nKeep in mind that I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend you to stay on those closed source platforms! I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend it, since you give them an extra user. These platforms only exist because of their users (and usually also the personal data of those users).\n  \rFacebook pills, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the original creator of the picture - CC0 licensed.\n\rSocial networking Social networking I already mentioned why it is probably a better choice as social media\u0026hellip; but it also has some disadvantages.\nDisadvantages The current most used social networking platform is probably email. Email has a lot of problems, but most people still use it because it is easy to use.\nSome, but far from all of those problems are spam. It is easy to spoof(fake) an email address and it is not encrypted by default. No encryption by default means that anyone who uses a packet analyzer on your network can see and read the contents of your emails.\nEmail is easy to use because the most people have it. It also isn\u0026rsquo;t too hard to use. Many sites use email to validate your account. Disposable email services exist if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to share your email with a website.\nIs it possible to not have these problems? It depends.\nThe problem is that good alternatives exist, but the communities are a bit small, so the norm isn\u0026rsquo;t using these platforms yet. This makes it harder to find people to have conversations with.\nYou can use these alternatives which might fix many of the problems which email has as a solution.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/technology/media-and-social-media/","tags":["Social-media","Technology"],"title":"Media and social media"},{"categories":["thoughts"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r What is normal?

Normal is the norm, being standard, a regular pattern. Normal is fitting in with the majority of people.\nThe word normal can mean something else for some people because they see other things as normal. This article is about the word normal as in living like the norm.\nMy thoughts I believe that no one is normal. Some people just try to look or act normal. I don\u0026rsquo;t see myself as a normal person either.\nDisadvantages of being different Not everyone likes that you are different People might bully you because you are different. You might be an easier target compared to others. This might be the biggest disadvantage, but this comes with a lot of advantages as well.\nHaters Everyone has different opinions. You can never be good for everyone. The norm might have some different opinions which might get you some haters.\nYou can try to change people their opinions, but remember that it is not easy to convince someone. Start with small things to see if they want to be convinced.\nPeople who follow the norm might get hate as well, but the norm is bigger as the rest. You could get more hate if you don\u0026rsquo;t follow the norm.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t try to be different just to be different, dare to be yourself. Being different to be different doesn\u0026rsquo;t really seems to have a purpose. There are better (and more valid) reasons to be different.\nPeople expect you to fit in You might have to make some sacrifices if you want to be what you like. I, for example, go to a college which uses closed-sourced software, and I don\u0026rsquo;t like many things which they teach. You sometimes just can\u0026rsquo;t seem to be who you would like to be.\nThis does not mean that I hate those people. I believe that hating does not give enough value back. It is probably not worth it. Some people found my keyboard layout pretty cool while others thought that it was weird, but I see that as a good thing.\nAdvantages of being different You are different and stand out People might remember you because you are different. You might stand out a bit. Standing out might even give you more chances to get success. It takes courage to stand out so it might also make you a stronger person.\nWould you rather hire someone with many cool skills or someone who is a part of the norm?\n \u0026quot; If you ain\u0026rsquo;t some kind of crazy, you ain\u0026rsquo;t shit. Facts! \u0026quot;\n\u0026ndash; Tech N9ne (I Caught Crazy)\n Fitting in takes effort Most people their true selves do not even fit into the norm. It requires effort to try to fit in.\nIt might be easier to use that effort to stand out. Being different is not easy either, but it can make you more interesting.\nYour views on some topics are different It is not always bad to see things from a different angle. You might have more important questions and statements which you can use in a discussion.\nWhat if? You will never see what you could be if will always try to fit in with the norm. You be even more amazing. It is not always easy to find what you are good at, but there is probably something.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/thoughts/being-different-is-better-than-being-normal/","tags":["Thoughts"],"title":"Being different is better than being normal"},{"categories":["recommendations"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r Introduction System setup scripts  Which operating system? Windows 10 GNU/Linux   Adblocking  Host file AdNauseam uBlock Origin   Password managers  KeePassXC Other options   Window management tools  GNU/Linux Windows Mac OS   Multiple screens and workspaces Editors  Xah Fly Keys   Keyboard  Ergonomic keyboards Keyboard layout Keybindings    \r\rIntroduction Good productivity makes your job easier. It will cost you less time. Here are some things which I use to increase my productivity.\nSystem setup scripts A script which sets your system up takes a while to make, but you will probably reinstall your system some day. It will save you time when you have to reinstall.\nWhich operating system? That depends. Try a few of them and see what works, use what works for you.\nWindows Windows has the biggest market, and drivers for most devices. It comes with much unwanted applications though.\nWindows also still uses much outdated things, like the NTFS filesystem, which is pretty slow compared to the EXT4 filesystem on GNU/Linux.\nWindows has the most software though. Microsoft Office and Adobe stuff is not available on GNU/Linux. Well, you can use Office 365 in your webbrowser on every operating system.\nYou can install a Linux subsystem on Windows, to gain the power of Linux on Windows, but it is not the same as running an GNU/Linux system.\nGNU/Linux GNU/Linux usually performs better than Windows if your drivers work. You will have to learn how to use it though. It offers much more customisation than Windows.\nYou will also love that it has no bluescreen and you only have to restart your computer if there is a kernel update.\nYou also don\u0026rsquo;t need a virus scanner on GNU/Linux, because it is very a secure operating system.\nJust give it a try. It might surprise you. It is also great if you want to script things which make your life easier.\nMac OS I haven\u0026rsquo;t used Mac OS personally. It looks like a fine operating system though.\nWindows 10 I do have some scripts which setup my system after I install Windows 10. Beware, these scripts can contain mistakes. I suggest you to read them and make your own.\nYou have to run the scripts as administrator.\n\rWindows 10 Scripts (codeberg.org) \n\rThere is also this tool which you can use. Learning how to write and manage your own scripts can often be a great skill though. It is not bad to know what you run.\n\rWindows 10 Setup Script (github) \n\rI also recommend you to install Chocolatey. You can more easily install and upgrade applications with Chocolatey. You won\u0026rsquo;t have to visit a site to install an application anymore.\nGNU/Linux Distro choice When it comes to GNU/Linux, distro choice matters. You want something which is easy to maintain in which you don\u0026rsquo;t have to add new repositories because some package isn\u0026rsquo;t in your main repository. That will save you time and make you more productive.\nMy suggested distro is Arch linux I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend to install Arch \u0026ldquo;the Arch way\u0026rdquo;, even if you haven\u0026rsquo;t done it before. It costs you time, and I personally don\u0026rsquo;t find that you learn much from it.\nI recommend you to use the Anarchy Arch installer. It will ask you which kind of install you want to do at some point.\nAnarchy-Advanced gives you the most control. I recommend you to pick that option if you have the time to search what every option means on another device. You can learn stuff from that. The other options are basically automated installs.\n\rAnarchy installer \n\rMy install scripts. Basically, I clone the git repository in my home and run the scripts in BashScripts/etcCreator. Beware the scripts might contain mistakes.\n\rdotfiles (codeberg) \n\rAdblocking Ads require resources to load. It usually doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect productivity, but I am sure that you want to get rid of them. Ads can slow down your browsing experience in some cases.\nHost file Ad blockers usually block most ads, but they increase the amount of memory and CPU. This slows down your browsing experience.\nI recommend to use a host file instead of an ad blocker. A host file also blocks ads that are included in your apps. This can sadly can\u0026rsquo;t be done on Windows systems.\nBrowsers and ad blocking Brave browser does adblocking by default. I think that it is a good step forward. It has some features which more browsers should implement in my opinion. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to install an adblocker on Brave.\nI also like Mozilla Firefox because I like to support competition and different choices.\nThere aren\u0026rsquo;t many browser engines, so there isn\u0026rsquo;t too much competition when it comes to that. The only big names Firefox (Gecko) and Chromium (Blink).\nhBlock The hBlock script makes one host file from a bunch of them. Ha, and for the Arch Linux users it is available in the AUR.\nRead here why host files don\u0026rsquo;t work on Windows:\n\rhblock does not work on Windows issue (github) \n\rAdNauseam I recommend to use AdNauseam if you can\u0026rsquo;t use a host file. AdNauseam uses uBlock Origin in the background and fakes the tracking data.\nGoogle banned this add-on from their web store, but they had no great reason for doing that. AdNauseam is a good way of protesting against ads.\nIt will click on ads and fake the ad-data. companies will lose money by using this. Google probably removed it because it also clicks on their ads.\nIt is heavier than uBlock Origin, but it is a great way to protest against ads.\n\rWebsite \n\r\rFirefox  Chromium  Opera \n\ruBlock Origin uBlock Origin uses less CPU and RAM as the most ad blockers. There is no proof that they allow some ads. Adblock plus does allow some ads.\nuBlock is actually not an ad blocker. It\u0026rsquo;s a general-purpose blocker. This add-on is not the same as the uBlock add-on.\nThe development from uBlock stopped. Donations to uBlock will not benefit those who contributed to uBlock Origin.\n\rFirefox  Chromium  Opera  Edge  Safari \n\rPassword managers Saving passwords in your browser is insecure according to many security researchers. The main focus of browser developers is often not security.\nPassword managers keep your passwords and usually have one master password you only have to remember that password, which saves you time. Remembering many passwords is a thing of the past.\nPassword managers can generate secure passwords for you. They also can automatically fill in your logins in browsers.\nKeePassXC Online password managers get leaked sometimes. I recommend KeePassXC, which is an offline password manager.\n\rWebsite \n\r\rFirefox  Chromium  Safari \n\rRead more about KeePassXC:\n\rYou should use keepass\r\r\rOther options I would recommand bitwarden if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to deal with moving your password database from your computer to your phone.\nOther options are fine too. A password manager is always better than no password manager.\nWindow management tools Window management by default is kinda annoying and not that productive.\nGNU/Linux JumpApp JumpApp is a very useful tool. It can bind a key to open an application if it is not running. It will jump to the window if the application is already open.\nSet it up for the applications that you use a lot. It will save you some time.\nWindow manager I use the tablayout in i3, so that every application is maximised by default. JumpApp also moves to the right tab (application) when I use it.\nI do have a key binding to let a window float, and to rearrange windows, but focusing on one time at the time helps. It keeps things findable.\nYou can use another window manager. JumpApp is the thing which you should give a try though. The window manager does not matter that much, but I like the way that i3\u0026rsquo;s tablayout works well with JumpApp.\nWindows You can setup AutoHotkey so that it acts like JumpApp (like in GNU/Linux). I recommend this. Xah Lee has a tutorial about AutoHotkey. It might be a good thing to read.\nRemove \u0026ldquo;WinMaxize\u0026rdquo; in my script if you don\u0026rsquo;t want it to maximize the window. Read the script and replace the application paths if you use other applications.\nYou can find my AutoHotkey scripts on codeberg. Place scripts in AppData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup if you want them to run when your system starts.\n\rAutoHotkey scripts (codeberg) \n\rMac OS Install Mac Quicksilver and set a key for your much used applications. I have never used Mac OS, but I know this from Xah Lee.\nCheck out Xah Lee\u0026rsquo;s YouTube channel, if you find some time. He uses a Mac OS and is often very productive.\nMultiple screens and workspaces I recommend you to not use multiple screens. It puts your focus on multiple things.\nThere is one exception though, having a YouTube video or tutorial on the second screen can be useful.\nIt could be good to position that screen above your current screen, so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to move your head too much.\nThe same goes for workspaces. It can make you lose some focus. These things exist for a reason though, so see what works for you. I personally recommend you to stick to one workspace.\nEditors Well, you know what I am gonna say.\nGNU Emacs and Vim. Well, unless you work with Java, just use some IDE for that, so there are some exceptions.\nThe Vim and Emacs default keybinding have problems. Xah Lee has articles about that. There is a solution though.\nYou can just work way faster in GNU Emacs and Vim once you have invested the time to learn it. You can stick to some other editor, but it is not bad to learn some new things, especially if it helps you in the long run.\nXah Fly Keys I personally use GNU Emacs with the Xah Fly Keybindings packages. You can play music and do everything in GNU Emacs, but I would suggest you to use the right tool for the job.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t master the Xah Fly Keys. It has a pretty big learning curve, but the things of it which I do use work great.\nSome of those extras which you can install on GNU Emacs are pretty heavy or are pretty ugly code hacks. I get why you would want to live in GNU Emacs, and it is a good concept, but things can be different in practice.\nKeyboard Ergonomic keyboards Ergonomic keyboards matter, but only if you spend much time on your computer, so much that many people would say that you spend too much time behind your computer.\nThey matter because of your health and fingers. I have had hand pain, but I no longer have that since I use my Ergonomic keyboard. Please look into Ergonomic keyboards if you have hand pain.\nI recommend the Kinesis Advantage 2. I own an Ergodox EZ. Ergodox isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad pick, but common complaints are that thumb keys can be difficult to press if you have small hands. I don\u0026rsquo;t have that probably though.\nKeyboard tilting The best way to tilt your keyboard is to the downside, in my experience. I know, most keyboards usually tilt to the upside.\nKeyboard layout Your keyboard layout only matters if you spend tons and tons of time behind the computer. I personally use Dvorak. Qwerty was made for typewriters.\nI think that Dvorak should become the standard, but that won\u0026rsquo;t happen, because people are used to Qwerty. Dvorak is designed for efficient typing, unlike Qwerty.\nKeep in mind that it can be hard to use the computer of someone else if you move away from some layout. My Dvorak keyboard can be plugged into a Qwerty computer and still type in Dvorak, so that is very useful.\nKeybindings Well, this a pretty big thing. I personally recommend you to use sticky keys. You don\u0026rsquo;t need caps lock when you use that. You do need shift though.\nOne other thing is that you want your strong fingers to handle the most stuff. Not your pinkies. You also want to use simple key sequences which aren\u0026rsquo;t too long.\nPrefer key sequences over key chords. Read Xah Lee\u0026rsquo;s keyboard page if you want to learn more about keybindings. He has done much research on keyboards and key bindings.\nTry to use shortcuts. It can often be faster than using the mouse. The mouse is still a great device for some stuff. It might be good to change some shortcuts though.\nYou should still have a mouse. Moving windows, resizing windows, 3D modeling and some other stuff is easier with a mouse.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/recommendations/computer-productivity/","tags":null,"title":"Computer productivity"},{"categories":["recommendations"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r My taste  Sections on this page   Sci-Fi series and movies Comedy series and movies Horror movies  Other horror stuff Horror movies which are hard to watch More hard to watch horror movies   Weird stuff, I guess?

Most people probably want to avoid these. I enjoyed them though.\nIn fact these movies are pretty incredible is a way. These movies are not supposed to be fun. These movies have a deep underlying message, even though not everyone see them.\n\r\rTitle\rDirector\r\r\r\rA Serbian Film\r\r\rSrđan Spasojević\r\r\r\rCannibal Holocaust\r\r\rRuggero Deodato\r\r\r\rMartyrs (2008)\r\r\rPascal Laugier\r\r\r\rTusk\r\r\rKevin Smith\r\r\r\rSalò, or the 120 Days of Sodom\r\r\rPier Paolo Pasolini\r\r\rMore hard to watch horror movies Read about these movies before you risk watching them!\nSure, these movies deserve to be seen by some people just like every movie. It are still movies, but you probably want to avoid these. I will probably watch some of these, just to see if there is any story.\nCannibal Holocaust, August Underground trilogy, Visitor Q, Guinea Pig, I Spit On Your Grave, Grotesque, Melancholie der Engel,\u0026hellip;\n\nNekromantik\nI have seen Nekromantik (1 \u0026amp; 2). It has a great soundtrack, but the story is boring and slow. The brutal animal killing (a rabbit in the first and a seal in the second movie) is the only really shocking thing in my opinion.\nThe seal part had disturbing music on top of it. That part was distgusting and actually worked very well as shock. It was the only really well done part in the franchise in my opinion. Too bad that the story of the movie is way too slow and uninteresting.\nThose videos were not made for the movie, but taken from slaughter footage, so that is at least a good thing. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that anything should die to create film or art, but using existing material is ok in my book.\nCulture changes with time. Stuff which was ok in the past is not always ok now, so my look at older movies which had animal cruelty is different, even though I don\u0026rsquo;t encourage it.\n\nThe Human Centipede\nI have seen The Human Centipede (1). The story was very weak in my opinion. There was no point in watching it. I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen the sequels, because they are probably just as uninteresting.\nIt is not that graphic. It feels like it is just made to be called \u0026ldquo;sick\u0026rdquo;. The movie was just bad. Not even in a good way. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t super graphical and the story was predictable. It was pretty boring.\n\nDisturbing movie overview\nLook up the YouTube channel \u0026ldquo;Nyx Fears\u0026rdquo; if you want to see someone ranking movies like these. I hope the video will convince you to not watch these. This stuff is not for everyone.\nWeird stuff, I guess?

It was directed by Antoine Fuqua.\nHaven\u0026rsquo;t seen, but want to see It is possible that I won\u0026rsquo;t like these movies though.

Art of the Devil 2 (2005, Thai horror movie) Many people seem to recommend to skip the first one. It apparently combines a great story and gore, so might be worth to check out. Misery (1990, horror, based on a Stephen King novel) Inside (2007, gore, thriller, New French Extremity). It is probably something like Martyrs. Don\u0026rsquo;t watch this if you want to see something fun. This type of movies aren\u0026rsquo;t meant to be fun, but they often have a great story. The Girl Next Door (horror, extreme). It is probably something like Martyrs. Don\u0026rsquo;t watch this if you want to see something fun. This type of movies aren\u0026rsquo;t meant to be fun, but they often have a great story. Oldboy (2003, action thriller) - Some people say that it is really, really good. Probably worth a look. Sounds promising.

My experience at FOSDEM Projects that I had not heard of  Open Source Design Apache Beam The illumos projects Google Summer of Code   Other interesting projects  GuixSD LibreOffice FSFE Librem 5 Even more projects    \r\rWhat is FOSDEM?  \rCopyright © FOSDEM - CC BY 2.0 BE licensed. Changes: compressed the image and changed the size of the image.\n\rFOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Belgium in Brussels.\nMy experience at FOSDEM FOSDEM was a great experience. There were a lot of interesting talks. I didn\u0026rsquo;t really socialize with many people, but I talked to some of the stands. I was mainly there for the talks, which were interesting, but it might be better to go for meeting people. It is personal preference.\nI am not saying that it is for everyone, since it is about free and open software and that might be a bit too nerdy/geeky for some people.\nProjects that I had not heard of Open Source Design A community of designers and developers pushing more open design processes and improving the user experience and interface design of open source software.\nApache Beam Apache Beam is an advanced unified programming model. You can choose your language and your runtime with Apache Beam. It is not the easiest thing to explain but it seems useful.\nThe illumos projects I had no idea that solaris based OS\u0026rsquo;s were still around. It is probably something that many people know about, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t.\nGoogle Summer of Code You probably didn\u0026rsquo;t expect Google to be on this list, but I like the idea behind this. Summer of Code is something for students that is supposed to give students an open source project.\nI think that it is a competition, but I am not sure. The cool thing is that it is all about open source. I haven\u0026rsquo;t checked of it also allows free software projects, but I think that it does. Open source is a great start though.\nOther interesting projects GuixSD GuixSD is an advanced distribution which respects the freedom of computer users. This distribution is almost completely written in GNU Guile. This is a distro that I really want to run. It is just so cool.\nLibreOffice LibreOffice is a powerful free (as in freedom) office suite. They were looking for contributors and LibreOffice is a cool project in general.\nFSFE You know that I had to talk to the Free Software Foundation Europe people, since I am a free software enthusiast. Belgium did not have a local group yet, but that can change. I was not the only one who talked about that apparently.\nHey, it is me from the future!: I formed an unofficial local group with people. It might become official some day. Please contact me if you are interested. The FSFE is aware of this. I might write an article about the group some day.\nLibrem 5 A project by Purism (which is a pretty cool company). The Librem 5 is supposed to become the first free (as in freedom) phone.\nI am not sure of it will be that free (as in freedom) when I listened to the answers of some people their questions. They also seemed to still have a few problems. I really want this project to succeed, but I am not sure of it will.\nIt is a great start for new projects. I find it a wonderful project. Many people would like to see something like this in free software.\nEven more projects There were too many projects to mention them all. Nextcloud, Gitlab, Ceph and many other unmentioned projects were also there. Most projects at FOSDEM are awesome, so don\u0026rsquo;t think that this list contains all the awesome projects.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/events/fosdem-2019/","tags":null,"title":"FOSDEM 2019"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r It is all in the details There is no such thing as the perfect programming language Software quality Things which bother me  Which methodology should you use?

Ha, you don\u0026rsquo;t format your code like this and you don\u0026rsquo;t use the \u0026ldquo;cloud\u0026rdquo;. You must be a bad programmer.\n  \rImage from Episode 13, Season 13 of The Simpsons. It is probably public domain licensed, since it is one of those internet jokes - CC0 licensed.\n\rAll those small things add up. It becomes super annoying. People spread a lot of nonsense about programming.\nThe worst part is that there just is no one right way. People make that stuff up, but you never see any proof. It is something that probably annoys many people.\nYes, some things are a bit better as others, but there is no one true way. You are not superior when you use some new trendy technology. It is probably good to find the right tool for the job, but the best tool can be something else for someone else.\nThere is no such thing as the perfect programming language People just should teach others how to use a language correctly. There are different styles and ideas in the programming culture because we are people. We like different things.\nFacts matter. Some languages are indeed faster or easier for some jobs, but that does not mean that everyone likes the syntax of that language. Syntax can make a language more easy to use for some people, so it is something that could matter.\nYou might find a programming language the best language, but remember that it is not the best language for every purpose or everyone.\nPeople just want to see a tool that works pretty fine in the end. You can develop it will a language which you enjoy. Think about the product which you want to make. It might even be great to think about you audience. You might want to pick another language as C# if you want to make a Free Software tool for example.\nWhat are the programming languages which fit your goals? Compare them. It might be useful to include the difficulty to learn the language as a factor.\nSoftware quality There are a few important factors to reach software quality:\n How good can the programmer(s) program (having a degree doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mean that you are good at it. I mean that you actually have knowledge, experience and skill.); How much do(es) the programmer(s) know about the project (It is useful to know something about money if the tool in development is a money management tool or something); How good the programmers work in team (if there is a team). How good you are at design patterns. This also depends on what you program. It might be less needed for some things.  Things which bother me Which methodology should you use? A better question might be: Does the methodology really matter?\nNone of these methodologies tend to be proven. Many of these methodologies change after a few years. It all sounds like a bunch of nonsense. They might help a bit, but how essential are they?\nMany great software has been developed without your \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo; methodology. I am not saying that it is bad to follow one. It might help for some people, but it is not essential and it isn\u0026rsquo;t a strict thing. Some people follow some of these things to the details, which might waste more time instead of getting things done.\nA small successful project can even be developed without any methodology. In fact, there is for example proof which shows that the popular Test Driven Development method isn\u0026rsquo;t always great.\nKeep in mind that design patterns are something different. I think that most of those make sense and can make you a better programmer.\nExamples of problems with methodologies TDD\nArticle: Problems with TDD - dalke scientific\nI know that the mentioned link is old, but it does contain some interesting text. Testing often helps, but I believe that TDD is not always needed. I agree that it does not cover every situation.\nThere are often some unexpected things which you probably want to have. Take for example a shopping website with coupons. People can try to add as much coupons, so that they get things free. This is probably something which you don\u0026rsquo;t want.\nIt is possible that you don\u0026rsquo;t reach a fix for that problem in TDD. Thinking like a user who tries to cause harm often helps to make your program more secure. This is not needed in TDD. This is why I think that TDD is not the only way.\nExtra testing can help. Trying a bunch of things when your program is finished can help to discover a lot of small problems. TDD can help, but don\u0026rsquo;t trust methodologies completely. They are not perfect.\nAgile\n \u0026quot; The word “agile” has become sloganized; meaningless at best, jingoist at worst. We have large swaths of people doing “flaccid agile,” a half-hearted 7 attempt at following a few select software development practices, poorly. We have scads of vocal agile zealots—as per the definition that a zealot is one who redoubles their effort after they’ve forgotten their aim. \u0026quot;\n\u0026quot; And worst of all, agile methods themselves have not been agile. Now there‘s an irony for you. \u0026quot;\n\u0026mdash; Andy Hunt, one of the founders of The Agile Manifesto\n \rFull article: The Failure of Agile\n\rI don\u0026rsquo;t even agree with his opinion. Following something strict can be great, but following it too strict can be a problem as well. It can cause fights over things which might not really matter.\nIt is good to have discussions, but try to use good reasons in a discussion.\nNew technology is not always better For example a simple webpage can ask for a lot of resources nowadays. Those resources can be used for tracking.\nI am fine if it asks resources for some advanced functionality\u0026hellip; but for SPYING? Are you serious? Spying?\nMany companies still see spying as a good thing, since selling personal data makes them money. This looks unethical to me.\nThere are other ways. You can, for example ask your users for feedback.\nBuzzwords Buzzwords are everywhere. It isn\u0026rsquo;t really specific to the programming culture. The thing about buzzwords is that they are usually not needed.\nA funny thing is that many smart people are great at explaining complex things in simple ways. They also seem to try to avoid buzzwords. The people who use it on purpose usually do it to look smarter as they are.\nIt might be likely that you don\u0026rsquo;t really understand the meaning of a word, if you use a buzzword.\nWe obviously need words to talk, but most buzzwords seem useless, since they don\u0026rsquo;t have a clear meaning. Use a different word or sentence instead if you can.\nTry to use words which most people understand\u0026hellip; Yeah, I get it buzzwords often help with marketing an idea or products and we often use them without realizing it.\nRelated article \r\rGNU Emacs is Unix\r\r- Explanation of why Unix is an unclear word\r\r\rPeople who spread that a programming job is fun Programming as a hobby is fun, but I thought about doing it as a job for a moment and realized that it is not what it seems. Doing it as a job usually means that you can\u0026rsquo;t choose what you create.\nThis takes away a lot of my motivation or interest in the job. They can limit what you can learn. A company can say you must use this programming language. The project can be something that you aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in at all.\nHere is a part of a Dual Core song. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get in such a situation. They even mention that the song is made for all the programmers and developers in the song.\n \u0026quot; I know I go and try but my life is broken, pulverized. Work and more and more, there\u0026rsquo;s less time to socialize. And that\u0026rsquo;s just a gamble, so why try and roll the dice? Either in the office or by myself at home, at night. Plus I stopped believing, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason keeping hope alive. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ndash; Dual Core (Unplug - Listen on YouTube)\n It can be a fun job as well, but it depends on more as one factor. Dare to talk about the downsides when you say that it is a fun job. It can be fun for some people, but you have to like the full package.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have a problem with programming as a job, but doing it all day on a project which does not interest me, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t improve my life quality. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy that.\nMy job ideas for the future I find programming nice as a hobby or for own projects, but don\u0026rsquo;t want to do it as a job. I could try to become a programming teacher or try to learn other things which interest me.\nI like to have some freedom. I think that something more creative might be better for me. I should look into 3D-modelling and 2D-animations and stuff. Art like that can take a lot of time, but the important part is that you enjoy it. Programming is not a bad job, but I think that it is not for me.\nMoney is nice, but happiness is important as well. Your time is limited. I recommend that you try to use it in a smart way. Make the best of it.\nGood things about the culture  There are almost always problems which you can try to fix; You often are able to get the opportunity to learn things; Not everyone does the things which bother me (and other people); Some companies treat programmers really well; Working from home might be cool thing, if you like that.  Just keep in mind that every culture has some problems or things which you don\u0026rsquo;t like. This is just my opinion.\nWhat others think Xah Lee is a pretty well-known GNU Emacs user. His Why Software Suck page contains his opinion about the programming culture.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/technology/the-programming-culture-has-problems/","tags":["Thoughts","Technology"],"title":"The programming culture has problems"},{"categories":["thoughts"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r Be patient Use better tools or make the task easier  How I made it easier to write this blog   Eliminate useless tasks  Do you can something back for your time? It is all in the details   Do something productive every day Focus on one task  \r\rBe patient Becoming more productive is not always and easy task. You can have big goals, but doing too much might cause a lot of stress or other unpleasant symptoms.\nYou can become more productive. Try to believe in yourself and take your time, but don\u0026rsquo;t waste too much of it either.\nUse better tools or make the task easier This is not always possible, but it could help a lot. It might even be possible to automate a task, which means less work and more time for you.\nHow I made it easier to write this blog Writting posts in pure HTML took time, since I had to surround the text with tags.

I can write my website in the org-mode of GNU Emacs now. I can type and create articles easier in org. This saves time. This is just a simple example, but it has more useful features.\nOrg-mode example:\n\r* This is a headline\rThis is a textblock.\r\rThis is another textblock.\rEliminate useless tasks It is completely normal to need some time to relax. Some relaxing things can be productive. You could try to replace less productive relaxing things with more productive relaxing tasks.\nFor example, replace games with watching educational videos or try to learn an extra skill which you find relaxing. Creating a own website is also something which you could learn from.\nGames might be useful if you are a game developer and/or seek inspiration, but they usually do more harm as good for the most people. You could seek info about the game instead of playing it if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to waste too much time.\nThere are debatable execeptions like educational games or playing games for the art. I don\u0026rsquo;t find most of the popular games that much of an art piece, but some games are trully wonderful.\nSocial media is also a timewaster which you might want to avoid. This isn\u0026rsquo;t the only reason to avoid it. You can read my Media and social media article for more information.\nDo you can something back for your time? Productive activities usually give you something back after a period of time. Something that you can see as an achievement. Learning something is a task which returns knowledge. Making a project might even return you donations. Drawning something might improve your drawning skills, which can also get you money or respect.\nIt is all in the details I have to admit that I usually also waste more time as I want to waste. Some things which you might not think about, might take a lot of time. It is probably also just healthy to not be too busy.\nThink about the tiny things which you do. Even putting pens which were inside a closet in a cup on a desk might help. This makes it easier to get the pen when you need it. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to open the closet and it is easy to pick up.\nDo something productive every day Big improvements don\u0026rsquo;t always happen in one day. Working hard can help to get where you want to be. Do something productive every day. This can be something simple.\nI try to do a small git commit every day. Not every commit looks valuable, but you improve something a tiny bit. A lot of tiny bits make something big.\nThere are exceptions though. You could get sick. It is good to push yourself, but everyone has a limit. You might need a break when you get sick.\nFocus on one task Many people can work better when they focus on only one thing. Multitasking often slows you down.\nMultitasking is not always bad.

Day against DRM 2019 Why is it bad?  It encourages piracy You can lose your product It can prevent people from using it Some other reasons   My experience with DRM How can you help?  \r\rWhat is DRM?   DRM means Digital Right Management, but some opponents of DRM prefer to call it Digital Restrictions Management.\nIt is a method to prevent the customer from doing certain things like making copies. DRM is a tool that restricts the user from doing certain things. DRM is about restrictions, not rights.\nDay against DRM 2019 Day against DRM focused on ebooks during 2019.\nMicrosoft deleted thousands of ebooks from ebook readers, smartphones and other devices.\nStudents had DRM on some textbooks in schools. Some students couldn\u0026rsquo;t access these textbooks because of the DRM on the textbooks. Everyone has the right on education, so why do people use DRM, which prevents many people from reading textbooks?\nThere are dust jackets available to print out and wrap around books. Please spread the word.\nWhy is it bad? It encourages piracy It fails to prevent people to illegally pirate the product. Many users who pirate a product don\u0026rsquo;t seem to have problems with DRM, since people can remove the DRM. It is probably illegal to remove it, but pirating is illegal as well.\nThe legal consumers who purchase a product seem to have the problems. This seems to encourage piracy, but it was probably made to prevent it.\nDo companies really believe that DRM is good for the marketshare of the product?\nYou can lose your product It is possible that you can lose a product, which you paid for. It has happened before and people don\u0026rsquo;t always get their money back.\nMany products which use DRM can\u0026rsquo;t be accessed without internet. This means that you lose the product when the servers go offline or when people decide to remove the product from the server.\nI repeat: Do companies really believe that DRM is good for the marketshare of the product?\nIt can prevent people from using it DRM capabilities on PDFs allow the maker of for example a PDF to block the ability to use a screen reader with it. This prevents blind people from making use of that content.\nI repeat again: Do companies really believe that DRM is good for the marketshare of the product?\nSome other reasons  DRM can track you; DRM also often hurts the performance of your product; DRM is simply bad for the consumers.  My experience with DRM I use a windows 10 KVM for college purposes. The steam trap caught me before I knew about DRM and free software. I will probably leave steam some day.\nThe steam alternative that I recommend is GOG. GOG is DRM-free. The struggle of not being able to play some games without internet is not the nicest thing to experience.\nI do not play a lot of games nowadays, since I have other things to do. Time is limited, so I prefer to work on projects instead of playing games.\nHow can you help? There are many ways to fight against DRM. Defective by design has a campaign against DRM every year. Their site also contains more ways to protest against DRM.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/events/day-against-drm/","tags":null,"title":"Day Against DRM"},{"categories":["technology"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r Does online privacy matter? Security Seek balance If you want to fight for privacy, do it right Are there any good security related tools? Conclusion  \r\rDoes online privacy matter? Yes, online privacy matters and some people really need it. It is a good thing to fight for. You deserve online privacy.\nShould you care though?\nSecurity The most important thing about online privacy is probably security.\nThe problem is that it often hurts convenience. It is often just not worth it and you can\u0026rsquo;t always fight against it.\nA big example is Cloudflare. It costs too much time to avoid. That does not mean that it is ethical to use Cloudflare, but convenience matters.\nIt feels like online privacy does not exist. Keep in mind that security does exist. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to give your passwords to attackers.\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t fight against everything without missing out on important things. Phones save every move you make. Google and many other big companies play with your personal data.\nSeek balance Make hard for the attackers, but not too hard. Not too hard still means that your security should be better than average.\nThere are enough people who are less secure as you. Attackers will pick those victims unless you are a very important person.\nFighting for privacy often takes away a lot of your convenience. You might be more productive without caring about all those things. I think that you should often pick productivity over security.\nThis does not mean that is ethical to take away the privacy of others. I respect people who fight for privacy and I believe that everyone needs privacy.\nIt is just sad that so many things are being controlled. I hope that GNUnet fixes some of the damage that has been done to the internet.\nIf you want to fight for privacy, do it right I dislike how some geeky privacy organisations spread the word.\nThey don\u0026rsquo;t use the platforms which they dislike. The people on the platform which they use are usually already convinced.\nThere is no point in spreading the information there. I recommend you to use the platforms which you dislike. Try to start some movement on the platform.\nBashing stuff is easy. Try to find solutions to the problem too, but stay active on the site you dislike until the majority of people have moved.\nIn general spread the word. You want to influence people. You can, as an organisation mention that you don\u0026rsquo;t support those sites on your website.\nThink about how the world works. Think about how you can reach the right people.\nAre there any good security related tools? I do recommend things like password managers. It makes your life even more convenient and more secure. It is worth it and you should use it.\nI have been a privacy geek before. Remember if you move too far to the privacy side, you will miss out on things and you will lose connections with some people. It is ok to choose privacy sometimes, but don\u0026rsquo;t let it ruin your life.\nIt is not bad to know how you can protect yourself, but also ask yourself of it is worth it. Security and privacy matters, but so does convenience and productivity.\nOne basic rule is think before you post something on the internet. This alone, can help you a lot. People can use your data against you.\nConclusion Choose how far you are willing to go, but don\u0026rsquo;t become too obsessed with it. Security and privacy matters, but so does convenience and productivity.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/technology/how-important-is-online-privacy/","tags":["Technology"],"title":"How important is online privacy?"},{"categories":["thoughts"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r What is an internet meme? The value of an internet meme Spam The internet meme culture Conclusion  \r\rWhat is an internet meme? An internet meme is commonly known as just a meme, which means something else apparently. An internet meme is an activity, concept, catchphrase, or piece of media that spreads, often for humorous purposes, from person to person via the internet.\nThat was a bit of text\u0026hellip; you can usually just replace the word internet meme with internet joke or internet content. The word internet meme is correct, but the word meme is probably technically incorrect.\nThat definition is pretty unclear. A simple avatar or profile picture is an internet meme, according to that definition. The internet memes that I wrote about in this article are the common sometimes funny images and short sometimes funny video formats of the internet memes.\nThe value of an internet meme An internet meme usually does not have a lot of value in my opinion. The jokes can be funny for a few minutes. The fun that you get from it usually does not last long.\nWatching a movie might satisfy you more if you want to have a laugh. Some of the internet memes are art, but most are just the same repitive jokes with different text. Some of them aren\u0026rsquo;t even funny in my opinion.\nSpam Many social media contains so many internet memes that it clutters the content which you might want to see. It can act like spam for the people who don\u0026rsquo;t want to see that content.\nAn internet meme often wastes space for educational or valuable content. Images can make your content more readable, but internet memes also don\u0026rsquo;t look formal in my opinion.\nThe internet meme culture There are different types and sizes of internet memes. Many internet meme communities claim that the internet memes from 9gag and ifunny are poorly made.\nInternet memes are often poorly made. There are exceptions, but even most of the famous 4chan memes are often pretty poorly made in my opinion.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t often visit well-known chans or forums. I usually only visit pages or boards about technology if I do.\nConclusion Internet memes often don\u0026rsquo;t bring a lot of extra value to something. They are often a waste of space. I might even block them if it becomes possible to do so.\nThey can be useful to fill up some content, but be careful if you do that. Your content might look less formal if you do that.\nThe biggest thing that I don\u0026rsquo;t like about memes is that they are overrused and you download them when you visit a page while you might not even want to see them.\nI also don\u0026rsquo;t like the word. I will try to use the word internet joke instead. I am not saying that anyone should ban it, since that probably won\u0026rsquo;t work anyways. The thing about these jokes is that it is an idea which many people seem to like.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/thoughts/are-internet-memes-overrated/","tags":["Thoughts","Technology"],"title":"Are internet memes overrated?"},{"categories":["events"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r How I heard about Ryako Brussels Light Opera Company Talking with Ryako More about Ryako  \r\rHow I heard about Ryako Twill Distilled from Wreck The System was chatting with me and asked if I had heard about Ryako.

I enjoyed it and was not disappointed.\nThe play was \u0026ldquo;Kiss Me, Kate\u0026rdquo; written by Samuel and Bella Spewack with music and lyrics by Cole Porter. A musical adaptation of Shakespeare’s \u0026ldquo;A Taming of the Shrew\u0026rdquo; directed by Fred Graham.\nTalking with Ryako Ryako did not have much time, but she was very kind. She gave me a bag with merch, gave me a hug and we had a chat.\nShe gave me a lot of merch (including a T-shirt which is not in the picture since I was wearing it). I expected to get nothing, but I got so much. She was able to do so much in such a small time.\n  \rPicture of the merch, which I got from Ryako, which is laying on my laptop - CC0 licensed.\n\r\nThe picture with her was made pretty quick. It is not my best picture, but it is nice that it exists now.\n  \rPicture of Ryako and me - CC0 licensed.\n\rShe did not have much time to work on the Full Of Stars video and was pretty exhausted. She also was busy with the Nerdcore VPC which you might know. I believe that she will make it in the genre. Her voice is great.\nShe will have more time for music now that the event has passed. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to ask a lot of questions because of the time. She also likes Twin Peaks which is awesome.\nMore about Ryako I find her website well designed. I usually don\u0026rsquo;t like all caps, but it fits the design. It also contains a text game if you look good enough.\nShe blogs from time to time.

It generates all your passwords for you. You only have to remember one password so using it is very convenient.\nSome versions can manage SSH keys for you. Forget all your fast made passwords. You only have to create and remember one strong master password.\nBrowser and mobile plugins for this database exist.\nSecurity KeePass generates strong passwords for you. Passwords can\u0026rsquo;t get cracked online, since the database is offline.

This creates some trust and I think that it was is a great pick for such a program.\nYou can read my Think before using the GPL license article for more information.\nWhich version? I recommend KeePassXC. It is a community fork of KeePassX.\n KeePassXC gets updated regularily; It works on Linux, Windows and macOS without modifications; You can import passwords from other password databases; TOTP generation (including Steam Guard) Has SSH Agent integration; Has browser integration; Has key file and YubiKey support for additional security; \u0026hellip;  I would recommend KeePass2 if KeePassXC isn\u0026rsquo;t available for you.

Use on computer  Install KeePass Open KeePass Create a new database and give it a master key (+ optional additional protection such as a key file and YubiKey). Create some entries– enter the username, password, URL (of login page), and optionally notes about the entry.

How can that even help and what happens?\n \rThe recycling symbol By Krdan Ielalir - CC0 licensed.\n\rThe recycling which works is usually recycling which you get money for. Most recycling is a lie. It is sad, but there are still things which we can do. It is a wonder that many people believe that all recycling helps.\nI am not saying that you should not recycle. The garbage has to go somewhere and it is better for the enviroment if not everyone has to drive to some place with a ton of garbage.\nPenn \u0026amp; Teller: Bullshit! has an episode which shows how recycling worked. You can find it on BitChute. BitChute uses Cloudflare. I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend it, but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find another source.\nKeep in mind that this problem is different for every country. There are things which do work. I just don\u0026rsquo;t find it ethical to spread lies.\nWhat can we do? Is there a solution? It will take a long time before an solution can be created. I think that it is possible, but it is difficult. We can at least care about the problem and work on it.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t have kids More people means more people who create garbage. You might not like this, but not having kids helps. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to follow this advice, and I understand that some people like kids.\nUse less Some people call using less, minimalism. I like that, but not everyone means the same when they use the word.\nI mean buying things or making decisions based on what you need instead of what you want with minimalism. It is a state of mind. This does not mean that you can\u0026rsquo;t have pictures and memories. You can do it in a extreme way, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to.\nMinimalism has other advantages as well. You can find things faster, since you have less stuff to look through. Less stuff means more money. Less stuff means less garbage.\nMinimalism does not mean that you give up all convenient things. You can take it that far, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to.\nTake care of your stuff Your stuff should last longer when you are more careful with it. Looking at which product is the best option also helps, since it might last longer as other products.\nUse things which last longer Compare a plastic water bottle and a glass water bottle for example. You can refill the bottles, but people often throw the small plastic bottles away. Those bottles become garbage. The glass bottle does not, unless someone breaks it.\nPlastic bottles might last long for you. This is just an example to show what I mean.\nSpread the word Tell people about the problems and explain why they should care.

People who disagree with the party which you voted for might hate you because they think that you agree with this or that.\nIt takes time Talking about politics takes time. There is a time a place to talk about it, but I find that it often brings more problems as solutions. I don\u0026rsquo;t even follow the media, since most things are lies and propaganda. Searching for the truth can take a lot of your time. I prefer to use my time for things which I find more important.\nThere are people with which I can talk about politics, but those people are people who dare to question things.

I am just not that interested in politics.\nWhat you vote for is often none of people their business in the first place, so why would you waste a ton of time on such a topic?\nNot everyone understands you You vote for things which matter to you.

There is politics in everything, but talking about some problems usually brings more trouble than it is worth in my opinion. It also depends on the person which you are talking with.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to associate myself with some person or party. It is pretty impossible to not talk about politics in some way.

Linux is the most used kernel and GNU is a common set of tools.\nWhy GNU+Linux is not the correct word Systems with BusyBox instead of GNU, systems which use the GNU Hurd kernel and many other systems exist. Calling those systems GNU+Linux isn\u0026rsquo;t completely correct, is it?\nThere are also many other things which run on your system. You probably won\u0026rsquo;t put them all into the name of the operating system. It is just not convenient to say such a huge name.\nWhy Linux is not the correct word Linux is just the kernel in theory. You don\u0026rsquo;t call Windows, Window NT kernel and you don\u0026rsquo;t call Mac OS X, XNU.\nFrom a marketing perspective I think that the word Linux often is easier to market. It is obvious that both words are used to market something. GNU likes the word GNU+Linux, since it gives the GNU project credit. I like the GNU tools, so I also use that word if I have to pick one of the those two words.\nLinux is what people know. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that it is bad to use that word. I do think that none of both words are correct for the reasons which I described in this article.\nSolution I don\u0026rsquo;t have a great solution for this naming problem, but I like to call it a distro. I usually use the distro name when I talk about a system. I use the word GNU+Linux as well.\nThe distro name might be the clearest thing that you can use. Another option is to just call the operating systems, distros. Distro is also not the best word, since it could mean a set of software components.\nWhat about calling it UNIX-like systems? The UNIX philosophy was made by AT\u0026amp;T which was a closed source company. GNU stands for GNU Not UNIX.

Security World\u0026rsquo;s fastest typist Possible Dvorak problems ErgoDox EZ  Why ErgoDox? Possible problems    \r\rWeird keyboard layout The keyboard layout which I use is the Dvorak layout. People have taken a picture of my keyboard and posted it on 9gag. They did this without asking because it looks weird. Yes, I know 9gag\u0026hellip; a closed source website which contains internet jokes.\nWhy would anyone use this layout?   \rPicture of the Dvorak layout - CC0 licensed.\n\rWell, look at it like this. We use QWERTY since people created that for typewriters so people knew the layout already. A typewriter needed a special layout like QWERTY since typewriters work with metal arms and those could jam.\nPeople created the Dvorak layout to replace QWERTY. That layout claims to require less finger movement which is also why many people claim that your typing speed increases when you use Dvorak. I find the Dvorak layout very comfortable to type on. I don\u0026rsquo;t use it to improve my typing speed. I do touch type though.\nSecurity Not everyone knows how to type on a Dvorak keyboard layout. This means that some cybercriminals also don\u0026rsquo;t know the layout. It is not a lot of extra security, but everything that helps, helps.\nWorld\u0026rsquo;s fastest typist The world\u0026rsquo;s current fastest typist is Barbara Blackburn. She broke the world record by using a Dvorak keyboard.\nPossible Dvorak problems Many people who use Dvorak (including me) forget how to type on their other keyboard layout (QWERTY for example).\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t always a problem. I recommend to get a external keyboard which can emulate Dvorak and QWERTY. It makes life easier for your colleagues and also for you when you have to work on other people their machines.\nErgoDox EZ Why ErgoDox? I am a proud owner of an ErgoDox EZ keyboard. It is expensive, but it is worth it.\nThe problem that I have with this keyboard is that I love it too much. Typing on a non-ergonomic keyboard like the keyboard which my laptop has is not as comfortable. I also miss my keyboard shortcuts and layers on other keyboards.\nThe ErgoDox EZ keyboard can emulate other layouts so I can emulate QWERTY. This is very useful when I have to use a virtual machine.\nSome virtual machines are preconfigured with the QWERTY layout. I can use this keyboard to emulate QWERTY so that I can easily change the default keyboard layout of the virtual machine to Dvorak.\nPossible problems Keep in mind that the ErgoDox is not perfect. The thumb keys are not easy to press with small hands. An problem which I personally have is that the legs aren\u0026rsquo;t that stable, but that is possibly because I don\u0026rsquo;t have the official ones.\nI recommend the kinesis advantage 2 keyboard if you do want great thumb keys. They are a bit better. Still not perfect, but better reachable.\nXah Lee has written a lot of stuff about keyboards.

I saw the first one, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and it was actually really good.\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) I expected it to be like Friday the 13th like movies, which I don\u0026rsquo;t like, but it is much different. I honestly don\u0026rsquo;t get the deal with Friday the 13th.\nThis movie does not contain much gore, but it is very well-made.\nThe acting in the first movie is really good and the movie looks pretty beautiful too. I mean the setting and and the recording style. The music is great too and the acting is incredible. This movie is a masterpiece.\nThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 Less realistic than the first one, but it introduces some cool things. It started a bit slower in my opinion, but it had the same vibe as the first one.\nAgain great music and acting. The acting in the original was incredible, but the acting in this one is pretty damn well too.\nIt has a tiny bit of (dark) humor, but not much. Don\u0026rsquo;t expect much humor. The characters are great too. It is a really good film, but the original was better in my opinion.\nLeatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III This movie was pretty\u0026hellip; bad. I was laughing because it was so bad. It started slow and the environment wasn\u0026rsquo;t so interesting. Also one of the actors really looked like he was in an action movie.\nIt gave me laughs, but not because it was good. This movie was a big disappointment. Honestly, just skip this movie, unless you want to see something bad.\nThe movie is also pretty random. It is like the script was written while the movie was being made.\nJust pretend that this movie does not exist\u0026hellip;, unless you want some laughs, but there are better movies for that.\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation Just like the previous one, this movie was pretty bad. There is a thing though. It was made to be funny. It was not that good to be honest. I didn\u0026rsquo;t like it.\nIt had a slow start. Many characters which you see when the movie starts don\u0026rsquo;t come in the rest of the movie.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t see why the start of this movie was needed. I had the same feeling about the last movie.\nRemakes I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen them yet and Michael Bay helped with the first remake, so the chance is very close to zero that I am gonna watch it.\nThe remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street was bad in my opinion. Guess who helped with it? Yes, the explosion lover, Michael Bay. Yes, some people like his style of movies, but I am not one of them.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong though.

The story isn\u0026rsquo;t great, but the movies were pretty well-made.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong though, the story of The Grudge is decent. I really liked these movies.

I do respect that they referenced real murders (which deserve more attention).\nReal murder references The real murder references weren\u0026rsquo;t always clear, and probably confusing for some people.\nYou probably want to read about The Nagoya Pregnant Ripper Case before you watch it. Many might see that part as Japan just being crazy, but that scene was based on the murder.\nThere is a subplot based on Tsutomu Miyazaki, AKA the \u0026ldquo;Otaku Murderer\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;The Little Girl Murderer\u0026rdquo;. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to know more about this murder.\nThe other real murders are usually news pieces, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to look them up. I suggest looking up Junko Furuta though. It is very dark, but I think that more people should know about that case.\nI have mentioned that case in my Horrible things happen and people try to hide it article.\nThe story The story was hard to follow in my opinion. The story is disturbing, but the scenes aren\u0026rsquo;t that graphical or scary compared to other movies.\nThe story is really all over the place. It is pretty confusing and it can feel like it doesn\u0026rsquo;t goes any where. It was interesting though.\nGive the series time. The better stuff starts during the fourth episode.\nOpinion This can be an interesting watch, but I am not sure of I would recommend it.

Be warned, Braindead has a more spooky vibe than Bad Taste.\nThe previous link contains a archive.org link, so that you can watch Braindead for free.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/reviews/bad-taste-movie/","tags":null,"title":"Bad Taste movie"},{"categories":["reviews"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r Martyrs (2008) movie  This movie sounds horrible The story Did this movie happen in real life? Other stuff    \r\rMartyrs (2008) movie Warning: this is not a fun film to watch. This movie is brutal and contains some gore, but it has a purpose.\nIt is about two girls, one of them was tortured when she was a kid and she left a girl behind when she escaped. So they decide to go to the family behind this.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t say more, and have a feeling that I have already spoiled much. The movie starts big and ends big. It already shows that it is a horrible film in the first shot.\nThis movie sounds horrible Yes, that is because it is. You won\u0026rsquo;t see every act visually (honestly be happy), but the visuals are great and it contributes to the story.\nKnow what kind of movie you are getting into before watching it. It is not just horrible. It has a great story too and is probably worth watching if you can handle this movie.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t watch the remake. The remake is much softer. Just watch the original it is much better according to many. I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen the remake though.\nThe story The story is a bit complex and the story is amazing. Call me sick, but I would watch it again for the story and please watch some reviews after the movie if you didn\u0026rsquo;t manage to understand the movie.\nIt is a really good movie when it comes to storytelling. It is really a masterpiece. I highly recommend it.\nDid this movie happen in real life? Just like A Serbian Film. No it is a fictional movie, but there was a time in which things like this happened, obviously not at the same level as in the movie.\nSmall rant for the \u0026ldquo;A Serbian Film\u0026rdquo; haters Yes, I just compared it with A Serbian Film. Stop the hating on A Serbian Film and look into its symbolism. It is a misunderstood piece of art. Sure, it is a bit much for some, but Martyrs is too. Both movies have a message.\nSo did it happen? Most religions do believe that there are ways to achieve transcendence, some less gruesome than others. Some thing alike could have happened.\nThere are legends about stories like the story in Martyrs. Some stories claim that something like it has happened.\nBesides that The symbol of the Catholic Church still features a man (Jesus) who is believed to have seen God in the last moments of his life as he was being tortured to death on a cross.\nOther stuff This movie is part of the New French Extremity genre. This means that it is very violent, but it has a soul underneath. It is a genre which most people might want to avoid.\nIt is not for everyone and please avoid this genre at all costs if you can\u0026rsquo;t handle it.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/reviews/martyrs-2008-movie/","tags":null,"title":"Martyrs (2008) movie"},{"categories":["reviews"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r Killer Klowns from Outer Space movie  \r\rKiller Klowns from Outer Space movie The title says it all.

The looks and audio This movie sounds horrible    \r\rA Serbian Film movie Warning: this is not a fun film to watch. This movie is brutal and contains some gore, but it has a purpose.\nThis movie tops many mainstream disturbing movie charts. It does not reach the top in some more underground, lesser known disturbing movie lists.\nThe movie is a really good thriller. It does its job really well.\nMisunderstood Many people dislike this movie, so I personally also avoided this movie for a while.\nMany people miss the point of this movie. There is so much symbolism in the movie and it is a fictional movie. Such things do happen in the world though.\nIt is a great movie with a bad reputation in my opinion.\nMovie description It is about a retired porn actor which needs money. Someone wants to hire him for a porn movie, but the movie contract does not say what the script is about.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t say more, without spoiling too much. The story is brutal and the acting is pretty great.\nWarnings It contains rape, pedophilic and necrophilic themes. The acts are shown, but just like Martyrs you don\u0026rsquo;t see everything of the act. It is disturbing though.\nIt contains much porn, the fragments aren\u0026rsquo;t too long, since the movie moves pretty fast. It can be awkward to watch it with family. I watched it alone. It is pretty easy to find and watch online.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t watch it if you can\u0026rsquo;t handle that content.\nThe symbolism The message The director and writer of the movie wanted to make a statement about politics. He also mentioned that many movies during that time were so politically correct, that it was absurd.\nThe characters in the movie represent the corruptness of the political system. The director of the movie mentioned that it is not just about Serbia. It is about the world in general.\nIt is not just disturbing to be disturbing. It has a serious message. You can interpret it in your own way too. A movie is a form of art after all.\nIt throws many questions at you like \u0026ldquo;What is art?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;How unrealistic is porn?\u0026rdquo; (usually very unrealistic obviously) and more. It is an underrated movie in my opinion.\nWhat does the sex in the movie represent? The sex is obviously symbolism. I mean, just look at how brutal it is, even the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; sex. Sure, the porn industry is fucked up, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look.\nThere was war in Serbia during the time that the creator of the movie lived there. There were concentration camps and slaughter in the streets.\nI think that the following quotes contain enough information to understand the symbolism behind that. They made the film as a protest to show how bad life was for them. You can find much symbolism in the movie.\n\n \u0026quot; We (Azra, her mother and sister) were running and there was a young pregnant woman. The soldier grabbed her and took a metal clothes hanger and he\u0026hellip; he stuck it in her\u0026hellip; and aborted the baby. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ndash; General Manager Azra\n \n \u0026quot; They fuck you when you\u0026rsquo;re born, they fuck you when you live, they fuck you when you die. \u0026quot;\n\u0026quot; It’s a picture of our society. \u0026quot;\n\u0026ndash; Actress Jelena Gavrilovic (played Marija in the film)\n If you don\u0026rsquo;t get the message The movie is still good if you don\u0026rsquo;t get the message. These events also happen in real life.\nThe events which happen in real life are also not mentioned enough in my opinion, so if you believe that it is based on real things, so be it.\nI actually find it amazing that this movie dares to show such topics. Those things need to be more known. I have written about that in my Horrible things happen and people try to hide it article.\nIs this an evil or real movie? No. The director is not crazy. This movie has a hero and a villain. The bad things aren\u0026rsquo;t seen as wonderful good things to do.\nNo children were ever in danger while filming this movie. The Serbian government investgated this film to confirm this.\nActors obviously saw the script before doing the roles and many of them like the movie or are proud of it.\nI actually find it a great movie and agree with the message. The world is very fucked up. People just don\u0026rsquo;t often talk about it. It is a very underrated movie. People just don\u0026rsquo;t understand it.\nThe looks and audio The film style is so great and fantastic. I really love this film style. I liked the music too, especially in the beginning. It has something.\nThey hold back on some shock graphics, but hinting and not showing often makes it darker. I like this. It hits hard, some parts of the story stick with you after watching it.\nThis movie sounds horrible Yes, that is because it is. You won\u0026rsquo;t see every act that visually (honestly be happy), but the visuals are great and it contributes to the story.\nKnow what kind of movie you are getting into before watching it. It is not just horrible. It has a message too and is might be worth watching if you can handle this movie.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/reviews/a-serbian-film-movie/","tags":null,"title":"A Serbian Film movie"},{"categories":["reviews"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r Cannibal Holocaust movie  Movie description Warnings The message The animal cruelty Are people killed in this movie? This movie was important in history Review    \r\rCannibal Holocaust movie Warning: this is not a fun film to watch. This movie is brutal and contains some gore, but it has a purpose.\nThis movie ranks high in many mainstream disturbing movie charts.\nMovie description The movie is about a team that is looking for people who went missing, and yes cannibals are involved.\nWarnings It contains rape and animal cruelty. The acts are shown clearly. You see everything of the act on screen. It is disturbing.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t watch it if you can\u0026rsquo;t handle violence.\nThe message Yes, this movie has an actual message. It is not just mindless violence. It makes you question what being civilized means. It is also about the media and how it is being manipulated.\nThis film actually tries to makes you think about the content of exploitation and disturbing films. Can people justify that kind of content? Is it all just film?\nI found the ending a bit predictable, but I think that it changes how some people look at films. It is a commentary on the modern world.\nThe animal cruelty This movie does not justify animal cruelty. It is real, but the people there kill animals, so the director first claimed that most of it was gonna happen anyways.\nThe tribes aren\u0026rsquo;t actually cannibalistic in real life though. He now claims that he was stupid to introduce animals.\nFilm historians claim that the deaths were quick and painless, but there are some deaths which don\u0026rsquo;t look painless to me, to be honest, but I am not a film historian.\nIt was a different time, but you can fake such stuff. It does highlight what kind of people they are, but that was already clear.\nThe animal killings don\u0026rsquo;t have a ton of purpose in the movie and some animals that were killed don\u0026rsquo;t have a ton of meat, so it is hard to defend it with that those tribes would kill them anyways.\nAre people killed in this movie? This movie feels very realistic, but no. Only animals were killed. I can\u0026rsquo;t say that the people are treated well though. The movie feels very real.\nThere is much debatable stuff in the movie, which makes you question of the people in the movie were treated well.\nIt is hard to defend the director. I don\u0026rsquo;t think that everyone who helped with the movie wanted to do what they did.\nCourt The director made people sign a contract so that they would not appear in any media for one year after the release of the movie.\nToo bad for him. People thought that the movie was real and he had to defend himself, because he was charged with murder.\nHe had to explain some special effects and had to prove that the people were still alive.\nThis movie was important in history This movie must have influenced censorship in some way. The effects were also really good.\nIt was the first film which did a part in the found footage style. I usually dislike that style a lot. This movie was not completely in that style, but it was done in a great way. I actually liked it.\nThe found footage genre was later popularized by The Blair Witch Project. The found footage genre wasn\u0026rsquo;t invented by The Blair Witch Project.\nI believe that it also had an impact on animal killing in movies. That it is usually not a good thing to do. It challenged what was acceptable in society.\nReview The animal scenes aren\u0026rsquo;t that long, and I expected it to be a lot worse. It happens in the second part of the movie. I actually like the first part of the movie more.\nThe film is overall very good. It was a lot better than I thought it would be. I think that it is worth watching if you can handle it. It\u0026rsquo;s history can make you feel bad, but the story that it tells is arguably still relevant. It is probably even more relevant now.\nIt is a hard movie to talk about, but here it is.\n","permalink":"https://robinwils.gitlab.io/categories/reviews/cannibal-holocaust-movie/","tags":null,"title":"Cannibal Holocaust movie"},{"categories":["reviews"],"contents":"\rTable of Contents\r Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom movie  Misunderstood History Why it is important The story The looks and audio Should you see it?    \r\rSalò, or the 120 Days of Sodom movie Warning: this is not a fun film to watch.

I think that many people won\u0026rsquo;t understand it. Yes, it has some kind of message.\nIt was very important for the history of film in my opinion. It does not inspire you, and feels hopeless, but that is kinda the point.\nHistory The politcal parties, left and right at the time were against homosexuals. Pasolini (the director) was an homosexual. Fascism was on the rise.\nSalò tries to push Pasolini\u0026rsquo;s opinion about those politics.

Such things do happen in the world though.\nPasolini was murdered before movie released. Many people think that it happened because of the movie.\nI heard that it is not Pasolini\u0026rsquo;s bests work and he does not want to be remembered by it.\nWhy it is important It was a movie which influenced censorship and the movie influenced many other movies. It was ahead of its time.\nIt pushed the boundary of film.\nThe story The story is incredibly disturbing and it still holds up today.\nPasolini luckily didn\u0026rsquo;t use everything of the source material. The book which it is loosely based on is much worse.\nThe book has so many acts, in a list form that it is boring to read. The book is also very disturbing, but the bad guys aren\u0026rsquo;t fascists in the book.\nIt was written, but never finished by Marquis de Sade, while he was in prison. The words \u0026ldquo;Sadism\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sadist\u0026rdquo; are based on his name. It show the darkest side of humans.\nThe looks and audio The pacing was really good. I believe that it had to have this length, so that it stays in the minds of the people.\nIt feels so real, because of its film style and music. It almost makes you a victim in some way. Many parts of the movie don\u0026rsquo;t have any music.\nThe music is good, but there isn\u0026rsquo;t much music in it, which adds to the realism.\nIt was pretty watchable. It was very disturbing for its time and it is still relevant. Similar things still happen. Keep in mind that this movie isn\u0026rsquo;t modern. The effects could be worse, but they still hold up.\nShould you see it? I think that people who are interested in film should see it. Regular people should see it if they know a bit about its history.\nIt was on archive.org, but it suddenly disappeared. I believe that it is public domain, so it might reappear on archive.org some day.\nYou can watch it on Effed Up Movies though. It even has subtitles there.
