&lt;h2 id="brave">Brave&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Brave is a FLOSS web browser which includes an ad blocker and gives you
free cryptocurrency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know, it sounds like a scam.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="link-list">

&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-good">Why is it good?&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="privacy">Privacy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is a step forward in privacy for many people. Most people use Chrome.
Brave is based on Chromium and provides some extra security features like
using Tor for private windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is not as secure as Tor browser and I don&amp;rsquo;t trust Chromium either, but
I believe that every browser isn&amp;rsquo;t great for privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Including Tor, even though it is still much better than many other
browsers when it comes to privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is not perfect. I2P might be better in many ways, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t
looked into it. Not so well-known stuff is sometimes more anonymous,
but it can be less secure too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are so many Firefox based and Chromium based browsers. Most
of those browsers don&amp;rsquo;t add many extra features.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="it-blocks-ads">It blocks ads&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Brave blocks ads by default, which is neat. The ad blocker is inspired
by uBlock Origin and Ghostery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are still people who don&amp;rsquo;t use an ad blocker. Ad blockers are good
for your privacy, since many ads come with trackers. Ads are just annoying.
Just block them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="it-pays-you">It pays you&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Browsers all kinda suck when it comes to privacy, but Brave does one thing
which most other browsers don&amp;rsquo;t do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It pays you, if you allow it to show some small notification like ads in
the corner of your screen. This is why I decided to give it a try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go to &lt;code>brave://rewards&lt;/code> and make sure that the ads slider is toggled and
the auto-contribute slider is not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have to make an Uphold account to claim the crypto. It isn&amp;rsquo;t
the simplest process to go through, but you get a tiny bit of crypto
every month. I get around 5 BAT a month from the notification ads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can get more if you allow donations in Brave Rewards. I configured it.
Brave is not a scam and gives you some crypto if you connect an Uphold
account.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="update">Update&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I just realised that you can earn more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go to &lt;code>brave://rewards&lt;/code> and click on the tiny settings button which I
failed to notice. You can ask Brave to show more ads here, which means
more BAT.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="donation-system">Donation system&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Brave comes with a donation system. Brave shows tip buttons on some sites
and you can use it to donate to people. This is pretty neat.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-i-don-t-like-about-it">What I don&amp;rsquo;t like about it&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You need an Uphold account to withdraw the money. Uphold works, but
I would like more choice. Uphold does not seem so privacy respecting
either. I get why they ask some personal data, but I believe that it
is not needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I like Firefox based stuff more than Chromium based stuff. I love the
developer tools of Firefox.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I would love some more customisation. It has customisation already, but
one thing which I absolulety love about Firefox based browsers is
the &lt;code>about:config&lt;/code> page.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I would recommend abrowser if you want a Firefox based browser. It is what
I currently use to test my websites in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using Firefox also means supporting competition which is good. Choice is
great, but getting free crypto is also welcome.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/div>
&lt;!--endtoc-->
&lt;h2 id="what-are-these-things">What are these things?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Gitlab and codeberg are platforms which use Git. Git is a system which
tracks your files, code and content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Git is useful because it is small and it provides history, so you can
go back if you mess something up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gitlab and codeberg also allow you to host a static website for free.
I use that functionality for this website.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="so-why-did-you-move-away-from-gitlab">So why did you move away from Gitlab?&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="gitlab-is-great">Gitlab is great&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Gitlab was great for what I did. It provides useful pipelines, which
most other Git platforms don&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A pipeline does somethings before your website or other projects gets
build. It is useful since it does not publish your result if something
went wrong in the pipeline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A pipeline can also contain tests and extra scripts. It is very useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is also Free Software, which is why I prefer it over Github
(Github is closed source). Codeberg is Free Software as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-it-is-no-longer-my-choice">Why it is no longer my choice&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>My reason for moving was that the &lt;a href="../../categories/articles/gitlab-404-pages-problem">404 pages no longer worked&lt;/a>. I was
patient, for a year. The issue still wasn&amp;rsquo;t fixed after a year and it
could influence my SEO in a bad way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I consider 404 pages important and every good businessperson knows that
the users are important, so they should have a good experience. Fixing
problems fast is something which users will enjoy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A 404 page is very important for some people. Check the previous
&amp;ldquo;404 pages no longer worked&amp;rdquo; link for more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t hate Gitlab and actually enjoyed using it. In fact, I still use
it for some projects and I will use it as a backup by mirroring some of
my projects to Gitlab.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="codeberg-is-even-better-in-some-ways">Codeberg is even better in some ways&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I knew that codeberg supported 404 pages, so I decided to move to
codeberg. I had used it before and it looked pretty decent.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-migration">The migration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some bugs popped up after migrating to codeberg&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created an issue after looking for a fix, and guess what? The amazing
developers fixed it in less than an hour!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ha, and by the way. They did this twice!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can take a look at the &lt;a href="https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/Community/issues/178" rel="external">closed issue&lt;/a> if you don&amp;rsquo;t believe me.
So the first plus for codeberg is &lt;strong>&lt;strong>great user support&lt;/strong>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is a big plus in my opinion. (&lt;em>This is my opinion. Oh, really is&lt;/em>
&lt;em>it? Why did I even type this text between these brackets&amp;hellip;&lt;/em>)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-text">More text&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One disavantage is that it does not have pipelines, but I used that as
an advantage. I have one repository with my hugo source and one with
the result now. I use a script to push my code to the other repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some advantages of codeberg:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Great user support.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Actual working 404 pages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>No more Google servers. Gitlab uses the Google servers to host your
content. Some people might block the Google servers for privacy
reasons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support competition, codeberg isn&amp;rsquo;t a big name yet, but it might
become one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can find my website source code there. (Sorry, this is a bad
joke and I mirror to Gitlab anyways.)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Codeberg is a fork of Gitea. It is light and does not have as many
features as Gitlab, but it has good user support in my opinion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ideas</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/projects/ideas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:10:52 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/projects/ideas/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;h2 id="dwmconf">dwmconf&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The package dwmconf will help you with building a custom
dwm configuration. The package will provide you the dwmconf
command. This command will have some parameters which will
help you with configuring dwm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also think about this project for another program.
This came to my mind, since many packages of the suckless
project aren&amp;rsquo;t that user friendly to install. This can make
one of their packages more user friendly to configure.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The purpose of this project is to help people with finding

&lt;h2 id="cloud-firewall">Cloud Firewall&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You might have heard of the Cloud Firewall browser extension.
The idea is to make the same thing, but as a actual application
which runs on your desktop. Firewall blocking by using the Firewall
of the system should work better than an add-on which does it by rDNS
requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="better-browser-engine">Better browser engine&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A browser engine is the core of every web browser.
It is the part of the browser which renders your pages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea is to create a browser engine with editable options.
These options should make it possible to create different configurations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some configurations could focus on privacy
while others could focus on a browser with many features
for average users.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why">Why?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The browser engine market is rather small,
but I hear many people complaining that they
can&amp;rsquo;t do some things in their browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some wanted features are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Keybindings (Vi and GNU Emacs ones for example)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better control over security settings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Default external link configuration (configuration options
could be: new tab, new window or default)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="how-can-you-achieve-extendibility">How can you achieve extendibility?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I was thinking of doing this by creating different packages.
The basic browser engine should already contain some by
default though. A bit like how repositories work.
The system which GNU Emacs uses as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="modern-new-editor">Modern new editor&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>GNU Emacs does not use code parsers to do the syntax highlighting or
at least not by default. The way that it does syntax highlighting is
by regular expressions. This can cause incorrect syntax highlighting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vi-like things are even worse, since they can&amp;rsquo;t even handle multiple
language syntax highlighting in one file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find the way in which GNU Emacs handles packages great,
but the editor is becoming more outdated. It works with repositories.
The defaults of GNU Emacs aren&amp;rsquo;t great either. I think that parsers
or not should be a choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would like keybindings like Xah Lee has, since he has invested a lot of
time in keyboards. Vi and Emacs keybindings are not good when it comes to
working for a long time. I do think that keybindings should be a thing which
is easily changable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do want a configurable config, just like the GNU Emacs one. It should
be lightweight and easy to install. I do want it to be a tiny bit more modern.
Some packages could be a bit more heavy, but lightweight alternatives should
exist.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dog Pictures</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/pictures/dog-pictures/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:10:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/pictures/dog-pictures/</guid><description>&lt;div class="lightbox">

&lt;h2 id="what-is-this-challenge">What is this &amp;ldquo;challenge&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Linux Challenge was a challenge in which questions about the common
commands on GNU and/or Linux systems must be answered within the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was mostly about knowing the standard coreutils of the GNU project, so more
a GNU challenge as a Linux one. There weren&amp;rsquo;t any question about the Linux
kernel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think that anyone has the possibility to know everything about the
Linux kernel or all the GNU utils.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The finals were in Belgium, so it was mainly meant for people from Belgium, but
other people could participate as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to give this a try, since I use GNU+Linux system. I use it daily,
but this does not necessarily mean that I really know GNU or Linux.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;div class="small-font">
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The student winners of the Linux Challenge 2019 standing next to each other - I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the license, but I am pretty sure that I can use this.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I am the person on the right, with the beard. I finished second of all the
students.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-questions">The questions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The questions were pretty doable in my opinion, but I am not going to say that
luck isn&amp;rsquo;t a factor. They mentioned that the scores were pretty high in general,
so the ones who did not win should be proud as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most questions went pretty smoothly, but not all did. I found the way in which
the challenge was done, pretty good and comfortable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="some-feelings">Some feelings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I felt a bit out of my comfort zone when they mentioned my name, since I did
not expect it. I am an introvert and was not very social or talkative during the
event. My dad drove me to the event and was also watching, which did not really
help either. I appreciate the support though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can only blame me for not talking much. It is something that I want to work
on. I am probably not the most asocial introvert, but being asocial happens
from time to time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="red-hat-talk-about-containers">Red Hat talk about containers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There also was a talk from Red Hat about containers. That talk was pretty
interesting. It was a good experience overall. It made me think that containers
could be a solution. I changed my mind after some research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are other ways, which are even better. Some people think that containers
provide more security from hackers, but this is simply not true and managing
containers takes time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The approach of the Guix package manager looks very great. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t
mentioned in the talk. The Guix package manager fixes many of the current
container problems. Containers are usually not reproducable, which is not great
for people who care about privacy and security. Guix packs are reproducable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GuixSD can even reproduce itself (the current whole system) as a live USB, in a
VM or other things. In other words it is very cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="isn-t-this-event-closed-source">Isn&amp;rsquo;t this event closed source?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It probably is in some way, but you have to make some decisions. I support free
software, but some privacy sacrifices might be worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="different-opinions">Different opinions&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I am not someone who complains about words which I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with. I try to
see why others have a different opinion, so that I can learn from that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I completely understand why people use the word &amp;ldquo;Linux&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;GNU+Linux&amp;rdquo;
or other words. Linux is just an easier word to market and people know the word.
This does not mean that I agree with the word. The GNU project deserves credit
in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My opinion about the naming problem: &lt;a href="../../about/the-gnu-linux-system-naming-problem/">The GNU Linux system naming problem&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="is-everyone-an-hypocrite">Is everyone an hypocrite?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Everyone probably depends on some closed source stuff (even if it are just some
protocols or bank card stuff). Everyone probably also depends on free software.
Everyone is probably a hypocrite.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;quot; All solutions are hacks. Every opposite is an equal (and if it attracts, look
out or you&amp;rsquo;ll make a sequel). Freedom&amp;rsquo;s a right but having any means you&amp;rsquo;re
privileged. And our religion of consumerism might have hit a glitch. Clowns are
unhappy. Jugglers drop stuff. I display cowardice whenever you talk tough. My
least favorite thing is a hypocrite, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be one. &amp;quot;&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="thanks-to-dot-dot-dot">Thanks to&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I would like to thank a friend who told me about this event. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have
heard about this event if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for her. That said, I felt like I owned
her a drink so I bought her one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I obviously also should thank the college, which I go to and the organisators
of the event. The college that I go to is called Hogeschool PXL and the
organisators of this event were EDITx and FPS Finance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Podcasts and shows</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/recommendations/podcasts-and-shows/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:09:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/recommendations/podcasts-and-shows/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;p>I am a free (as in freedom) software enthusiast from Belgium.
I like software that respects your freedom. This does not mean
that I don&amp;rsquo;t respect people who use closed source software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everything that someone does or uses is a choice and I
believe that people have a reason for why they do something.
It is not always a good reason, but I accept it. I don&amp;rsquo;t
know their life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be able to get to know me when you read this website.
There are many things which could describe me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Firefly series and Serenity movie</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/firefly-series-and-serenity-movie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 20:45:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/firefly-series-and-serenity-movie/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Custom 404 pages stopped working a year ago for &lt;code>*.gitlab.io&lt;/code> domains. A
404 page is a page which you get when a URL can&amp;rsquo;t be found on a website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages/-/issues/183"
title="404 pages not served on Gitlab"
rel="external nofollow">
Gitlab issue
&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-this-is-a-major-bug">Why this is a major bug&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="frameworks-and-libraries-are-more-difficult-to-use">Frameworks and libraries are more difficult to use&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many libraries like React show incredibly useful error messages on the
404 page when stuff stops working.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="it-can-break-the-seo-for-websites">It can break the SEO for websites&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>SEO means how high you rank in search engines. Backlinks (links from
other websites to your website) are very important for SEO.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those backlinks can link to a completely broken page if a website
decides to change some URLs and does not have a working 404 page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The website should show a 404 page instead. Many of my backlinks are
going to be invalid now, which is not great.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-this-bothers-me">Why this bothers me&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Well, it is going to affect my SEO. The issue was created last year.
I think that such an issue is way too important to ignore. It isn&amp;rsquo;t
a minor thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="solutions">Solutions&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="buy-a-domain">Buy a domain&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Another solution is buy yourself a domain and use it. It does work if
you use another domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="move-to-another-platform">Move to another platform&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>People are going to hate this, but moving to another platform is a
solution. Github does not have this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would suggest that you host your website there instead until Gitlab
fixes this. They will probably lose some users because of this bug, but
I overall like Gitlab.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure, Gitlab uses the Google servers to host your site on, but it still
feels more open than Github (which is owned by Microsoft) and it has
wonderful pipelines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gitlab has pipelines, which is really useful. It is a reason to move
for many people.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-will-this-website-do">What will this website do?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I might move to Github pages if this stays broken. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to wait
much longer for 404 page support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Codeberg had the same problem and it only took them a few hours to fix
it, not even a day. I will probably move to codeberg pages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I migrated my site to codeberg.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moving also means that I would lose much SEO, but it might also mean
that it might not happen again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-don-t-you-fix-it-yourself">Why don&amp;rsquo;t you fix it yourself?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Well, I have other stuff to do and I believe that Gitlab has a pretty
big codebase. It would require much time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Add-ons</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/recommendations/add-ons/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:16:44 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/recommendations/add-ons/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;h3 id="adnauseam">AdNauseam&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I recommend to use AdNauseam if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to use a host file (or if you
want to use an ad blocker and a host file). AdNauseam uses uBlock Origin in the
background and fakes the tracking data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google banned this add-on from their web store, but they had no great reason
for doing that. AdNauseam is a good way of protesting against ads. It will
click on ads and fake the ad-data. companies will lose money by using this.
Google probably removed it because it also clicks on their ads.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="ublock-origin">uBlock Origin&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>uBlock Origin is the last option that I can give you if none of the other
options are for you. It uses less CPU and RAM as the most ad blockers. There is
no proof that they allow some ads. Adblock plus does &lt;a href="https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads#revenue" rel="external nofollow">allow some ads&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>uBlock is actually not an ad blocker. It&amp;rsquo;s a general-purpose blocker. This
add-on is not the same as the uBlock add-on. The development from uBlock
stopped. Donations to uBlock will not benefits those who contributed to
uBlock Origin.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Saving passwords in your browser is insecure according to many security
researchers. The main focus of browser developers is probably not security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Programs which do have a main focus on security exist. One of those programs is
KeePassXC. Online password managers also get leaked sometimes and this is the
reason why I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A password manager is also pretty easy to use. You only have to remember your
master password (use a strong password for this) and the other passwords are
generated. Generated passwords tend to be secure.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Connecting to a website with HTTPS protects the user from many attacks, since
it is encrypted. Using HTTP is less secure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HTTPS doesn&amp;rsquo;t secure you from man-in-the-middle services like Cloudflare, but
HTTPS is important.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Smart HTTPS add-on tries to force HTTPS, but will use HTTP when this is not
possible. In fact it is itself an upgrade from the very popular add-on
developed by the EFF known as HTTPS Everywhere. The Smart HTTPS add-on is
lighter on your resources.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="gnu-librejs">GNU LibreJS&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>GNU LibreJS only allows JavaScript with a free license to run. I no longer
recommend this add-on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that GNU LibreJS will never work in practice unless some law forces
people to license their JavaScript in a GNU LibreJS way. It kinda misses the
point. The idea is not bad, but it just does not work currently.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="block-tracking">Block tracking&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="cloud-firewall">Cloud Firewall&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Cloud Firewall add-on can block connections to pages and web resources
hosted in major cloud services if the user wishes to do so. Supports blocking
Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Cloudflare. Cloud Firewall has
a whitelisting option, so that it can disable blocking on specific websites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I highly recommend this add-on. It might be a bit extreme for some, but it has
the possibility to block popular CDNs, which many people associate with spying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read my &lt;a href="../../categories/articles/say-no-to-cloudflare">Say no to Cloudflare&lt;/a> article for more info about the Cloudflare problem.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Privacy Possum makes tracking you less profitable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The owner of the add-on worked on Privacy Badger which is an EFF add-on. He
found the privacy benefits limited which is why he created this add-on.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Stylus is a fork of the popular Stylish add-on, which can be used to restyle
the web. Stylus is a fork of Stylish that is based on the source code of
version 1.5.2, which was the most up-to-date version before the original
developer stopped working on the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Stylish project added a tracking analytics component which collects data
when the original developer left.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="torswitch">TorSwitch&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This privacy focused list couldn&amp;rsquo;t be complete without mentioning Tor. This
add-on connects to a Tor proxy. The Tor package on GNU+Linux and variants of it
use this proxy by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This add-on will make your browsing experience slower. Tor claims to offer
anonymity, but you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t trust it completely. Exit nodes can be sniffed and
such.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="user-agent-switcher">User-Agent Switcher&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can spoof your User-Agent string by using this add-on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pretending to be a different browser can be useful in a number of different
situations. Web pages can require someone to use a specific browser to access
their site.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="umatrix">uMatrix&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This add-on is a bit like a small firewall. It gives you lots of control of
your privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>uMatrix puts you in full control of where your browser is allowed to connect,
what type of data it is allowed to download, and what it is allowed to execute.
Nobody else decides for you: You choose.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and

software from all over the world gather at the event in Belgium in Brussels.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-experience-at-fosdem">My experience at FOSDEM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>FOSDEM was great, just like &lt;a href="../../articles/fosdem-2019">last year&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were a lot of interesting talks.
I actually met someone from the Fediverse this year. We missed out
on meeting an other person who uses the Fediverse, because we
just couldn&amp;rsquo;t find each other. Hey, at least I met someone which is cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I met OTheB at FOSDEM. He is developing his own programming language. We
had some nice talks.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t talk to many of the stands this year. We saw many talks though.
You can&amp;rsquo;t do everything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed it and would go again. I am not saying that it is for everyone,
since it is about free and open software and that might be a bit too
nerdy/geeky for some people.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="projects-that-i-had-not-heard-of">Projects that I had not heard of&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="sourcehut">Sourcehut&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Sourcehut is a platform for Git, like Gitlab and Github. The cool thing
about Sourcehut is that people don&amp;rsquo;t have to create an account to
contribute to projects. It also uses bash scripts, so you can easily
make some kind of pipeline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It looks very promising. Honestly, it is possible that Github or Gitlab uses
the same idea some day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kde-itinerary">KDE Itinerary&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>KDE Itinerary is a digital traveling assistant focused on protecting your
privacy. I think that it is not fully free (as in freedom), but it surely
looks great. You no longer need the google API to travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really recommend to check this one out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="musescore">MuseScore&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>MuseScore is a free and open-source program to create, play and print
music sheets. The fun part was when I got home and my sister (who
plays violin) said that she knew it and actually used it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="other-projects">Other projects&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="gnu-linux-phones">GNU/Linux phones&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The KDE and Pine stands were always packed with people. Those stands had the
new GNU/Linux phones. There were some interesting talks about the phones as
well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I personally am going to wait until more phones have been released. OTheB
ordered the Librem5 when they asked for donations. It is cool that these
things exist now. I really look forward to getting one, when the time is
right.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="haiku">Haiku&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Haiku is an free and open-source operating system based on BeOS. BeOS is
an OS from 1995. They had gratis disks with Haiku on it. I managed to get
one and installed it on my previous laptop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It really feels like a system from a few years ago. I am not sure what I am
going to use it for. It is different than many operating systems, and that
is cool in a way. I hope that some software runs on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="gnunet">GNUnet&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We managed to catch a talk about GNUnet. GNUnet is a new more secure
implementation for the internet. It replaces every layer in the OSI model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was pretty technical, but it was worth it. Some layers of GNUnet are
ready to use. They are talking to many other organizations and already have
standardized some parts of the new model. GNS which will replace DNS has
been through that process already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that it will take a few years before you can use it in
production environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another cool thing is that GNUnet, written in C, can be extended on. It
can be done in different languages. So you can basically replace a part
in the model with your own code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="matrix">Matrix&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have been negative about Matrix before in my Cloudflare article, but lets
look at reality. It is getting more popular and is a solution for connecting
different messaging systems. I still don&amp;rsquo;t want to use it, but they are
doing something cool. I rather avoid Cloudflare on things which I use often.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="even-more-projects">Even more projects&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There were too many projects to mention them all. Nextcloud, Gitlab, Godot
and many other unmentioned projects were also there. Most projects at FOSDEM
are awesome, so don&amp;rsquo;t think that this list contains all the awesome projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I no longer use Wayland</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/why-i-no-longer-use-wayland/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:10:02 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/why-i-no-longer-use-wayland/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;p>Wayland is a display server. It is more secure and less complex than
Xorg. There are also some other benefits. Wayland is the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can read the following article for some Wayland
tips: &lt;a href="../../articles/trying-wayland-and-sway">Trying Wayland and Sway&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-not-wayland">Why not Wayland?&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="drivers">Drivers&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some drivers seem to rely on Xorg, like some drawing tablet drivers.
Some drawing tablet drivers already work though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The closed source NVIDIA drivers are also not supported yet, but
honestly use AMD instead if you have the option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many reasons to not like NVIDIA for GNU/Linux users,
but that article is for another day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="jumpapp">Jumpapp&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Jumpapp doesn&amp;rsquo;t works with tablayout in Sway. It does work in i3.
I highly recommend using tablayout and jumpapp. It increases my
productivity a lot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Set some jumpapp bindings in your i3 config. Having everything
in fullscreen gives you focus. Tiling is a bit overrated in my
opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is useful to have a key to have two windows on your screen,
but having too many windows on your screen makes things complex.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="keyboard-configuration">Keyboard configuration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some keyboard configuration isn&amp;rsquo;t available on Wayland yet.
I can&amp;rsquo;t configure Shift to do Shift lock instead on Wayland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Swapping CapsLock with Ctrl worked though. One way around
this issue is by making your own keyboard layout. I don&amp;rsquo;t
find that user-friendly enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sharing-your-screen">Sharing your screen&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Sharing your screen isn&amp;rsquo;t that well-supported on Wayland yet.
Recording your screen is possible, but you need to use the
supported applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-opinion">My opinion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I do believe that Wayland will get some support and I
loved using it. Most things work and I would love to use
it when some of these minor problems get fixed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why is this website so simple?</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/who-is-this-website-so-simple/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:09:23 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/who-is-this-website-so-simple/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;h2 id="the-readers">The readers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My readers might like simple things. It makes it easier to read for many
people, since there aren&amp;rsquo;t too many distractions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It could be even simpler, but I want that it works and that it is easy to use
for the most people. Making it too minimal would take away that it is easy to
use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will also provide some other &lt;a href="../../about/website-themes">themes&lt;/a> in case you don&amp;rsquo;t like the style of this
website.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="it-is-fast">It is fast&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It could still load fast if I would have added more styles or even JavaScript.
There is a difference between a page which loads extremely fast and a page
which loads fast. This website should be readable on slow internet connections
unlike many other sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="it-is-easier-to-manage">It is easier to manage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Adding more elements means that you also have to manage those elements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="it-works-on-many-browsers">It works on many browsers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This website should work on text-based browsers, unlike many other websites. It
won&amp;rsquo;t work on very old browsers, since it uses HTML5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HTML5 should make the website easier to read for people who use screen readers.
I want that this website works for the biggest group of people. That includes
people with reading problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="it-is-privacy-friendly">It is privacy friendly&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many websites and ads track you. I don&amp;rsquo;t like programs which spy on users and
many other people don&amp;rsquo;t like that either.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Movies anime and series</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/recommendations/movies-anime-and-series/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 21:13:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/recommendations/movies-anime-and-series/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;p>The Human Centipede didn&amp;rsquo;t make it. The story was very weak in my
opinion. There was no point in watching it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the sequels, because they are probably just as
uninteresting. It is not that graphic. It feels like it is just
made to be called &amp;ldquo;sick&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The movie was just bad. Not even in a good way. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t super
graphical and the story was predictable. It was pretty boring.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="horror-movies-to-avoid-at-all-costs">Horror movies to avoid at all costs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Read about these movies before you risk watching them!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="small-font">
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I also avoid these and haven&amp;rsquo;t seen them. Grotesque (2009) is probably
also one of these, but it can&amp;rsquo;t be as bad as the titles under this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A Serbian Film, Cannibal Holocaust, August Underground trilogy,
Visitor Q, Guinea Pig, Salò (or the 120 Days of Sodom),
I Spit On Your Grave,&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That are the popular ones which you should avoid. Some people claim
that you have to see Salò, since it is art and it won&amp;rsquo;t get out of
your mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Honestly, read the wikipedia page about it first. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the
movie. I might some day with people who can watch such a thing, but I
will watch other movies first. It is not something which I plan to watch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Look up the YouTube channel &amp;ldquo;Nyx Fears&amp;rdquo; if you want to see someone
ranking movies like these. I hope the video will convince you to not
watch these.&lt;/p>

images to this page later, if I find a way to use movie cover
images legally.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Skin I Live In (drama, thriller 2011)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dark City (Sci-Fi, 1998)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Metropolis (Sci-Fi, 1927)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Audition (1999, horror, drama)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heavily Creatures (psychological thriller, 1994, Directed by Peter
Jackson)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some more Directed by David Lynch movies (One of the creators of Twin
Peaks)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The ABCs of Death (horror, comedy, each short story is by another
filmmaker. Should be good to find some great horror filmmakers)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Johnny Mnemonic (so bad it&amp;rsquo;s good, Sci-Fi 1995)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Requiem For A Dream (about drugs, depressing)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trainspotting (1996, black comedy crime film, about drugs, depressing)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hot Fuzz action (comedy, second film in the Three Flavours Cornetto
trilogy)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Training day (cop movie, crime thriller)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>House, original title Hausu (horror comedy, should be a weird one)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Three (2002) and Three&amp;hellip; Extremes (2004) movies with three segements
from different directors from Asian countries.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Art of the Devil 2 (2005, Thai horror movie) Many people seem to
recommend to skip the first one. It apparently combines a great story
and gore, so might be worth to check out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Misery (1990, horror, based on a Stephen King novel)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Inside (2007, gore, thriller, New French Extremity). It is probably
something like Martyrs. Don&amp;rsquo;t watch this if you want to see something
fun. This type of movies aren&amp;rsquo;t meant to be fun, but they often have
a great story.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>

&lt;p>FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and
collaborate. Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source
software from all over the world gather at the event in Belgium in Brussels.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-experience-at-fosdem">My experience at FOSDEM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>FOSDEM was a great experience. There were a lot of interesting talks. I didn&amp;rsquo;t
really socialize with many people, but I talked to some of the stands. I was
mainly there for the talks, which were interesting, but it might be better to
go for meeting people. It is personal preference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not saying that it is for everyone, since it is about free and open
software and that might be a bit too nerdy/geeky for some people.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="apache-beam">Apache Beam&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Apache Beam is an advanced unified programming model. You can choose your
language and your runtime with Apache Beam. It is not the easiest thing to
explain but it seems useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-illumos-projects">The illumos projects&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I had no idea that solaris based OS&amp;rsquo;s were still around. It is probably
something that many people know about, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="google-summer-of-code">Google Summer of Code&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You probably didn&amp;rsquo;t expect Google to be on this list, but I like the idea behind
this. Summer of Code is something for students that is supposed to give
students an open source project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that it is a competition, but I am not sure. The cool thing is that it
is all about open source. I haven&amp;rsquo;t checked of it also allows free software
projects, but I think that it does. Open source is a great start though.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="other-interesting-projects">Other interesting projects&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="guixsd">GuixSD&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>GuixSD is an advanced distribution which respects the freedom of computer users.
This distribution is almost completely written in GNU Guile. This is a distro
that I really want to run. It is just so cool.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="libreoffice">LibreOffice&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>LibreOffice is a powerful free (as in freedom) office suite. They were looking
for contributors and LibreOffice is a cool project in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fsfe">FSFE&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You know that I had to talk to the Free Software Foundation Europe people,
since I am a free software enthusiast. Belgium did not have a local group yet,
but that can change. I was not the only one who talked about that apparently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Hey, it is me from the future!:&lt;/em> I formed an unofficial local group with
people. It might become official some day. Please contact me if you are
interested. The FSFE is aware of this. I might write an article about the group
some day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="librem-5">Librem 5&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A project by Purism (which is a pretty cool company). The Librem 5 is supposed
to become the first free (as in freedom) phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not sure of it will be that free (as in freedom) when I listened to the
answers of some people their questions. They also seemed to still have a few
problems. I really want this project to succeed, but I am not sure of it will.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a great start for new projects. I find it a wonderful project. Many
people would like to see something like this in free software.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="even-more-projects">Even more projects&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There were too many projects to mention them all. Nextcloud, Gitlab, Ceph and
many other unmentioned projects were also there. Most projects at FOSDEM are
awesome, so don&amp;rsquo;t think that this list contains all the awesome projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Media and social media</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/media-and-social-media/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:10:04 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/media-and-social-media/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;p>Both words mean that it is a way to share messages or ideas with others, but it
are rather vague words. It is hard to give these words a correct meaning, but I
gave it a try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Social media is a part of the media nowadays and many people use the media to
impact others. It is the best way to reach people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Social media and the media aren&amp;rsquo;t so different. You can only see a bit of the
world at the time, in other words, people have an impact on you all the time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I see social media as the full package which includes media and other stuff.
Social networking is usually included in this full package.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean the part in which people chat or talk with others when I use the word
social networking. Social networking applications are things like IRC, email,
videocalls and chatting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some might see these things as social media, but I see it as a different thing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That research might have shown you, why social media is probably not healthy

they make it addicting and that they always knew this.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;quot; It’s a social-validation feedback loop&amp;hellip; exactly the kind of thing that a

&lt;p>It usually contains a lot of propaganda and lies. It can contain some truths as
well, but many people also believe the lies, since they don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or
are too lazy to do some research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People get paid to promote stuff. Social media is still a marketing tool. The
media also has this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="privacy-problems">Privacy problems&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many people including kids, probably don&amp;rsquo;t read the extreme policies which you
accept by making a social media account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some policies of the popular Facebook network allow them to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use all the information which they receive about you. That includes things
which you haven&amp;rsquo;t done yet. Nothing you do on Facebook is private. (This
gives them permission to constantly spy on you);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Collect information about things which you do after you leave their website;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use your identity, even in ads;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Give your data to partners. Partners can mean a lot;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that this isn&amp;rsquo;t even everything. I recommend the &amp;ldquo;Terms of

&lt;p>Your time is valuable. Life’s short. Don&amp;rsquo;t let social media eat your time,
many people don&amp;rsquo;t realize how much time social media really takes. Not much (if
even anything) is worth living a life that you wouldn’t like. Nothing is worth
putting aside what you have always wanted to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="good-reasons-to-use-social-media">Good reasons to use social media&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="is-using-it-to-stay-in-contact-with-others-any-good">Is using it to stay in contact with others any good?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Using it to have contact with others is a bad reason in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People who care about you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t abandon you if you care about your privacy
and/or your health when you move to a different platform. It might be less easy
to use, but that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your good friends will try to stay in touch in some other way. Your other
&amp;ldquo;friends&amp;rdquo;, you probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t trust them too much. People use others to
reach their goals all the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Social media is probably not going away soon. It is important to know your
limit if you decide to use that poison. Test what it does to you if you spend a
few weeks without social media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel better in general when I stop using social media for a while. Do what
feels right in the long run and play with the options. How much time on social
media is too much?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="to-influence-people">To influence people&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is the only good reason that I could find to use social media. Influencing
people is useful when you try to sell a product or an idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is just the fastest and easiest way to market something. Many people use it
and it works. There are other ways though. I add share links, so that I don&amp;rsquo;t
have to have an account on those platforms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My share links don&amp;rsquo;t use any tracking JavaScript, since I don&amp;rsquo;t find it ethical
to track users.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="share-buttons">Share buttons&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Facebook like buttons violate the GDPR and I bet that it isn&amp;rsquo;t the only
social media button which tracks everything you do, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a
Facebook account. This is a reason why some people like myself often block
JavaScript.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I added custom share links for these platforms. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I won&amp;rsquo;t use the
buttons which these platforms provide. I cares about your privacy. It is just
a way to get my content to the people who aren&amp;rsquo;t aware of these problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that &lt;strong>I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend you to stay on those closed source
platforms!&lt;/strong> I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend it, since you give them an extra user. These
platforms only exist because of their users (and usually also the personal data
of those users).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I already mentioned why it is probably a better choice as social media&amp;hellip; but
it also has some disadvantages.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The current most used social networking platform is probably email. Email has a
lot of problems, but most people still use it because it is easy to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some, but far from all of those problems are spam. It is easy to spoof(fake) an
email address and it is not encrypted by default. No encryption by default
means that anyone who uses a packet analyzer on your network can see and read
the contents of your emails.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Email is easy to use because the most people have it. It also isn&amp;rsquo;t too hard to
use. Many sites use email to validate your account. Disposable email services
exist if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to share your email with a website.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="is-it-possible-to-not-have-these-problems">Is it possible to not have these problems?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It depends.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem is that good alternatives exist, but the communities are a bit
small, so the norm isn&amp;rsquo;t using these platforms yet. This makes it harder to
find people to have conversations with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use these alternatives which might fix many of the problems which email
has as a solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tips-for-new-social-networking-platforms">Tips for new social networking platforms&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Email is something which most people have, because most people need it to
validate themselves on websites. Make sure that your social networking platform
has something like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mark my words, email will probably stop being used some day. It could be your
platform that replaces it. Think about how you can make it attractive to the
norm.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Website themes</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/website-themes/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:09:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/website-themes/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cloudflare is:&lt;/strong> Cloudflare is a content delivery network, which means that it
has different servers in different locations. Websites which use Cloudflare
should be better reachable, so faster in different countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloudflare is not just a content delivery network. Cloudflare is also a
reverse proxy (= a middleman between the user and a website), a DDoS
mitigation service (= a service which tries to resist or make the impact of a
DDoS attack less painful).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloudflare is even more as that. Many websites are a part of the Cloudflare
content delivery network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>In easy words:&lt;/strong> Cloudflare claims to try to make sites faster
and more secure. It is a service which a lot of websites use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Sounds pretty nice, right?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="privacy-problems">Privacy problems&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Do you want to disallow people who need and deserve the right on privacy from
using your website?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Great! Use Cloudflare!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="reverse-proxy">Reverse proxy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A reverse proxy acts as a man-in-the-middle, which means that it &lt;em>might&lt;/em> spy
on everything which your users do. Cloudflare is a reverse proxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A man-in-the-middle service is something which is between the site and the
user. This means that they can easily add JavaScript which spies on you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="it-keeps-a-globally-unique-id">It keeps a globally-unique ID&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Cloudflare creates a cookie which gives your browser a globally-unique ID.
This even happens when the website is using SSL and shows a little padlock in
your browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This pretty much kills privacy. A globally-unique ID can easily be used
to track you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tor">Tor&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Cloudflare sites usually block Tor. Cloudflare does not provide you anonymity
even if it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t block Tor. Cloudflare would let people use Tor, if they
really cared about security. Tor is made for security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They technically don&amp;rsquo;t always block Tor access, but the reCAPTCHAs don&amp;rsquo;t
function correctly, which can make it hard to visit a Cloudflare site
through Tor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be able to change this in the security settings for your site.
Keep in mind that most sites won&amp;rsquo;t do this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Source: &lt;a href="https://blog.torproject.org/trouble-cloudflare" rel="external nofollow">The Trouble with Cloudflare - Tor Blog&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="google-captchas">Google CAPTCHAs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Not all sites with Cloudflare use CAPTCHAs, but many do. CAPTCHAs are the
things which try to check if you are &amp;ldquo;human&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It sends your personal data to Google, since it uses the CAPTCHA from Google,
which does more than just checking if you are a robot. Some people even claim
that it tries to find out which human you are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember that Google is an advertisement company. Most of their money comes
from selling your data. In fact the privacy policy which you accept by using
almost any Google product allows them to do this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The funny thing is that there are computer programs (robots), which can solve
the &amp;ldquo;prove you are human&amp;rdquo; CAPTCHAs.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="project-honey-pot">Project Honey Pot&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Project Honey Pot is a project which collects a lot of user data and much of
that data is from innocent users who deserve privacy. Cloudflare was created
by people who worked on that project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloudflare has leaked private user data before, so it has something in common
with &amp;ldquo;Project Honey Pot&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Companies which don&amp;rsquo;t show the source code probably don&amp;rsquo;t show it for a reason.
Spying might be one of them. Showing the source code is usually a great way to
find bugs and to improve your code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will probably say more about this in another article.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="firefox-and-cloudflare">Firefox and Cloudflare&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Mozilla (Firefox) has partnered up with Cloudflare and will resolve the domain
names from the application itself via a DNS server from Cloudflare. Cloudflare
will then be able to read everyone&amp;rsquo;s DNS requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can disable it in &amp;ldquo;about:config&amp;rdquo;. The string value of &amp;ldquo;network.trr.uri&amp;rdquo;
should be empty. Some other settings can also contain Cloudflare URLs. It is
recommended to search for &amp;ldquo;cloudflare&amp;rdquo;. GNU Icecat and older Firefox versions
are not affected &lt;em>yet&lt;/em>. Tor Browser is also Firefox based, but you don&amp;rsquo;t have
to use Tor Browser to use Tor.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that the configured DNS resolver of your computer might be
Cloudflare DNS. You can find guides on the internet about setting the DNS
nameservers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recommend the Quad9 DNS resolver. Some of their DNS nameservers use DNSSEC,
which means that your DNS queries aren&amp;rsquo;t in plain text. This means that it
provides you extra privacy. Quad9 is a nonprofit organisation. It looks
trustworthy enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that DNS is just a pretty insecure protocol by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most GNU and/or Linux systems have a /etc/resolv.conf file, but programs like
wicd and NetworkManager change these settings. Those programs usually have a
settings menu to set the DNS nameservers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="think-about-your-visitors">Think about your visitors&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Do you like it when websites ruin a bit of your experience?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In other words: &lt;em>Would you love to visit a website which forces you to solve a&lt;/em>
&lt;em>&lt;strong>annoying timewasting puzzle&lt;/strong> usually after&lt;/em>
&lt;em>&lt;strong>waiting five seconds&lt;/strong> which also cost you valuable time?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Awesome! Use Cloudflare!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="your-users-matter">Your users matter&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Every visitor helps. Think about their experience. They make your website
successful. They like to see your content. They probably would like it when the
website opens quickly without too many junk.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="who-is-your-userbase-dot-dot-dot-and-what-do-they-like">Who is your userbase&amp;hellip; and what do they like?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Focus on them. Some of them probably care about their privacy. You will have
fewer visitors if you don&amp;rsquo;t support them. That influences the success of your
website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I highly doubt that they will like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>To solve a CAPTCHA;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To wait for five seconds for no good reason.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What possible users which care about privacy probably won&amp;rsquo;t like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>That your site isn&amp;rsquo;t easily reachable through Tor;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That your site is hosted by some company which many people don&amp;rsquo;t trust. (I
know that this site still uses the Google servers, I still need to fix that,
but I currently don&amp;rsquo;t spend any money on this website.);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That the JavaScript which the site uses is necessary;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That the JavaScript isn&amp;rsquo;t freely licensed. Some people like myself try to
use GNU LibreJS (or even disable JavaScript) when it is possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="just-to-be-clear">Just to be clear&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>People who care about privacy aren&amp;rsquo;t criminals&lt;/strong>, or at least not always. In
fact, &lt;strong>everyone needs privacy&lt;/strong> in one way or another. Everyone has the right
to privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People who really think that they don&amp;rsquo;t need privacy should be ok with sending
me their address, private conversations, access to their webcam, passwords and
more. &lt;em>Don&amp;rsquo;t actually do this.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An important example are whistleblowers. They have in many cases shared useful
information. Many of them can lose their job if they aren&amp;rsquo;t anonymous enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Legal &amp;ldquo;.onion&amp;rdquo; sites exist. Some examples of this are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Facebook (closed source social media)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DuckDuckGo (Search engine, the core of this search engine is closed source)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Protonmail (webmail, the mobile app is closed source)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;em>That is a excellent question.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It isn&amp;rsquo;t simple to not use websites which aren&amp;rsquo;t served by things like
Cloudflare without any extra tools. Cloudflare is a big privacy problem. I
however have tips for the people who care about privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="extensions">Extensions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are browser extensions which fight against this problem. I recommend the
Cloud Firewall add-on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="cloud-firewall">Cloud Firewall&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The Cloud Firewall add-on can block connections to pages and web resources
hosted in major cloud services if the user wishes to do so. Supports blocking
Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Cloudflare. Cloud Firewall has
a whitelisting option, so that it can disable blocking on specific websites.&lt;/p>

Mentioning why Cloudflare is not the best option might help. I recommend that
you recommend them an alternative. (Feel free to send me some alternatives,
I want to list some of them on this website)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You could write an article or share other people their articles with other
people. Make more people aware of this problem.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="the-stop-cloudflare-repository">The Stop Cloudflare repository&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The following git repository contains more reasons and links to articles of
other people. I highly recommend checking it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is an amazing source of information. The structure of the repository might
make it a bit hard to look through it. Many who read this probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
have problems with finding what they are looking for.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="removing-matrix">Removing Matrix&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Matrix.org apparently also uses Cloudflare, so I decided to remove my
matrix account after writing this article. I don&amp;rsquo;t see it as something
which offers you privacy if it decides to use Cloudflare.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t recommend Matrix because of this problem. Even if it might be
solvable by self-hosting, since you probably will recommend it to
friends. Those friends might decide to use the official Matrix server.
Those friends could be using Cloudflare without knowing the dangers of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fediverse-problems">Fediverse problems&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Avoiding all Cloudflare sites is probably not easy, but I will do what I can.
The content on the Fediverse can be served by Cloudflare, but it only serves
the content of other instances which use Cloudflare through Cloudflare.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use the Cloud Firewall add-on and won&amp;rsquo;t whitelist the instance which I use,
which means that I can&amp;rsquo;t see the pictures and some other media when I am using
Mastodon or Pleroma.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-changed-again-after-a-few-extra-months">I changed again, after a few extra months&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="is-privacy-worth-it">Is privacy worth it?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I think that productivity matters more than privacy. There are tools which
provide productivity while also being better for security and privacy. Take
a look at &lt;a href="../../categories/articles/you-should-use-keepass/">KeePassXC&lt;/a> for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would go for the more secure alternative if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt my productivity
too much. I do this because I still want to support privacy for the people who
need it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong privacy is important, but not enough people fight
for it. Make sure that you are a bit more secure than average users, but
don&amp;rsquo;t overdo it.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-is-drm">What is DRM?&lt;/h2>
&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="../../images/articles/international-day-against-drm/eliminate-drm.jpg"
alt="The eliminate DRM logo. The text on the logo is &amp;#39;ELIMINATE DRM DefectiveByDesign.org&amp;#39;." width="260" height="162"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>DRM means Digital Right Management, but some opponents of DRM prefer to call
it Digital Restrictions Management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a method to prevent the customer from doing certain things like making
copies. DRM is a tool that restricts the user from doing certain things. DRM
is about restrictions, not rights.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="day-against-drm-2019">Day against DRM 2019&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Day against DRM focused on ebooks during 2019.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft deleted thousands of ebooks from ebook readers, smartphones and
other devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Students had DRM on some textbooks in schools. Some students couldn&amp;rsquo;t access
these textbooks because of the DRM on the textbooks. Everyone has the right
on education, so why do people use DRM, which prevents many people from
reading textbooks?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are &lt;a href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org/dayagainstdrm/2019/dust-jacket" rel="external">dust jackets&lt;/a> available to print out and wrap around books. Please
spread the word.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-is-it-bad">Why is it bad?&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="it-encourages-piracy">It encourages piracy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It fails to prevent people to illegally pirate the product. Many users who
pirate a product don&amp;rsquo;t seem to have problems with DRM, since people can remove
the DRM. It is probably illegal to remove it, but pirating is illegal as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The legal consumers who purchase a product seem to have the problems. This
seems to encourage piracy, but it was probably made to prevent it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Do companies really believe that DRM is good for the marketshare of the
product?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="you-can-lose-your-product">You can lose your product&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is possible that you can lose a product, which you paid for. It has happened
before and people don&amp;rsquo;t always get their money back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many products which use DRM can&amp;rsquo;t be accessed without internet. This means that
you lose the product when the servers go offline or when people decide to remove
the product from the server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I repeat: &lt;em>Do companies really believe that DRM is good for the marketshare of
the product?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="it-can-prevent-people-from-using-it">It can prevent people from using it&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>DRM capabilities on PDFs allow the maker of for example a PDF to block the
ability to use a screen reader with it. This prevents blind people from making
use of that content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I repeat again: &lt;em>Do companies really believe that DRM is good for the
marketshare of the product?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="some-other-reasons">Some other reasons&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>DRM can track you;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>DRM also often hurts the performance of your product;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>DRM is simply bad for the consumers.&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="my-experience-with-drm">My experience with DRM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I use a windows 10 KVM for college purposes. The steam trap caught me before I
knew about DRM and free software. I will probably leave steam some day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The steam alternative that I recommend is &lt;a href="https://www.gog.com" rel="external nofollow">GOG&lt;/a>. GOG is DRM-free. The struggle of
not being able to play some games without internet is not the nicest thing to
experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do not play a lot of games nowadays, since I have other things to do. Time is
limited, so I prefer to work on projects instead of playing games.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-can-you-help">How can you help?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are many ways to fight against DRM. Defective by design has a
&lt;a href="https://www.defectivebydesign.org/dayagainstdrm" rel="external nofollow">campaign against DRM&lt;/a> every year. Their site also contains more ways to protest
against DRM.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Religion</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/religion/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:09:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/religion/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;h2 id="religion">Religion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I am an Atheist just because I have never seen a God. I am not saying that
something like it could not exist. The universe is big.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is good to question some things. Many things which people find normal aren&amp;rsquo;t
one of the better ways to do something. Look at keyboard layouts for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do believe in karma, so I believe that doing good things will bring you good
things and that doing bad things will bring you bad things. I also just don&amp;rsquo;t
see the purpose of not trying to live your life righteous.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="philosophical">Philosophical&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I believe that everyone supports someone&amp;rsquo;s ideas, not the person. It is hard to
say that you really support someone completely. This is more philosophical as
religious.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I try to have no enemies, but others might see me as a enemy. Supporting one
idea usually means that you are against another idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like Bryan Lunduke would say &amp;ldquo;Be excellent to each other&amp;rdquo;. It might be easier
said as done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You could try to view everyone as equal and treat them that way. The truth is,
we all have different talents. We are not equal. I, however try to stay polite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like to think about psychological things. You can find some of those things
in my articles, but it might not be obvious.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blade Runner 2049 movie</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/blade-runner-2049-movie/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 20:57:20 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/blade-runner-2049-movie/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;p>Twill Distilled from Wreck The System was chatting with me and asked if I had
heard about Ryako. I did not at the time, but I looked her up right after I
heard about her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The funny thing is that she joined the chat room when we chatted about how cool
some of her songs are. Much thanks to Twill to tell me about Ryako.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I am lucky to live in Belgium, the same country as Ryako. She private messaged
me about a musical which she participated in. I went to the event.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="brussels-light-opera-company">Brussels Light Opera Company&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The event itself was enjoyable. I had never been to a musical before. I had,
however, seen &amp;ldquo;Little Shop of Horrors&amp;rdquo; which is a musical. I highly recommend
it and Ryako also likes it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The costume designs were neat and the actors performed well in my opinion.
The Chorus was great as well. I enjoyed it and was not disappointed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The play was &amp;ldquo;Kiss Me, Kate&amp;rdquo; written by Samuel and Bella Spewack with music and
lyrics by Cole Porter. A musical adaptation of Shakespeare’s
&amp;ldquo;A Taming of the Shrew&amp;rdquo; directed by Fred Graham.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="talking-with-ryako">Talking with Ryako&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ryako did not have much time, but she was very kind. She gave me a bag with
merch, gave me a hug and we had a chat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She gave me a lot of merch (including a T-shirt which is not in the picture
since I was wearing it). I expected to get nothing, but I got so much. She was
able to do so much in such a small time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>She did not have much time to work on the Full Of Stars video and was pretty
exhausted. She also was busy with the Nerdcore VPC which you might know. I
believe that she will make it in the genre. Her voice is great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She will have more time for music now that the event has passed. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able
to ask a lot of questions because of the time. She also likes Twin Peaks which
is awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="more-about-ryako">More about Ryako&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I find her website well designed. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t like all caps, but it fits
the design. It also contains a text game if you look good enough.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>People complain about the smallest things in programming. Ha, you don&amp;rsquo;t format
your code like this and you don&amp;rsquo;t use the &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>. You must be a bad
programmer.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>All those small things add up. It becomes super annoying. People spread a lot
of nonsense about programming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The worst part is that there just is no one right way. People make that stuff
up, but you never see any proof. It is something that probably annoys many
people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, some things are a bit better as others, but there is no one true way. You
are not superior when you use some new trendy technology. It is probably good
to find the right tool for the job, but the best tool can be something else for
someone else.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="there-is-no-such-thing-as-the-perfect-programming-language">There is no such thing as the perfect programming language&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>People just should teach others how to use a language correctly. There are
different styles and ideas in the programming culture because we are people. We
like different things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Facts matter. Some languages are indeed faster or easier for some jobs, but that
does not mean that everyone likes the syntax of that language. Syntax can make a
language more easy to use for some people, so it is something that could matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might find a programming language the best language, but remember that it is
not the best language for every purpose or everyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People just want to see a tool that works pretty fine in the end. You can
develop it will a language which you enjoy. Think about the product which you
want to make. It might even be great to think about you audience. You might
want to pick another language as C# if you want to make a Free Software tool
for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What are the programming languages which fit your goals? Compare them. It might
be useful to include the difficulty to learn the language as a factor.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="software-quality">Software quality&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are a few important factors to reach software quality:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How good can the programmer(s) program (having a degree doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily
mean that you are good at it. I mean that you actually have knowledge,
experience and skill.);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How much do(es) the programmer(s) know about the project (It is useful to
know something about money if the tool in development is a money management
tool or something);&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How good the programmers work in team (if there is a team).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How good you are at design patterns. This also depends on what you program.
It might be less needed for some things.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="things-which-bother-me">Things which bother me&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="which-methodology-should-you-use">Which methodology should you use?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A better question might be: &lt;em>Does the methodology really matter?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>None of these methodologies tend to be proven. Many of these methodologies
change after a few years. It all sounds like a bunch of nonsense. They might
help a bit, but how essential are they?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many great software has been developed without your &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em> methodology. I
am not saying that it is bad to follow one. It might help for some people, but
it is not essential and it isn&amp;rsquo;t a strict thing. Some people follow some of
these things to the details, which might waste more time instead of getting
things done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A small successful project can even be developed without any methodology. In
fact, there is for example proof which shows that the popular Test Driven
Development method isn&amp;rsquo;t always great.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that design patterns are something different. I think that most of
those make sense and can make you a better programmer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="examples-of-problems-with-methodologies">Examples of problems with methodologies&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>TDD&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Article: &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150930115748/http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2009/12/29/problems%5Fwith%5Ftdd.html">Problems with TDD - dalke scientific&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know that the mentioned link is old, but it does contain some interesting
text. Testing often helps, but I believe that TDD is not always needed. I agree
that it does not cover every situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are often some unexpected things which you probably want to have. Take
for example a shopping website with coupons. People can try to add as much
coupons, so that they get things free. This is probably something which you
don&amp;rsquo;t want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is possible that you don&amp;rsquo;t reach a fix for that problem in TDD. Thinking
like a user who tries to cause harm often helps to make your program more
secure. This is not needed in TDD. This is why I think that TDD is not the
only way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Extra testing can help. Trying a bunch of things when your
program is finished can help to discover a lot of small problems.
TDD can help, but don&amp;rsquo;t trust methodologies completely. They are
not perfect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Agile&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;quot; The word “agile” has become sloganized; meaningless at best, jingoist at
worst. We have large swaths of people doing “flaccid agile,” a half-hearted 7
attempt at following a few select software development practices, poorly. We
have scads of vocal agile zealots—as per the definition that a zealot is one
who redoubles their effort after they’ve forgotten their aim. &amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;quot; And worst of all, agile methods themselves have not been agile. Now there‘s
an irony for you. &amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;mdash; Andy Hunt, one of the founders of The Agile Manifesto&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t even agree with his opinion. Following something strict can be great,
but following it too strict can be a problem as well. It can cause fights over
things which might not really matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is good to have discussions, but try to use good reasons in a discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="new-technology-is-not-always-better">New technology is not always better&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For example a simple webpage can ask for a lot of resources nowadays. Those
resources can be used for tracking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am fine if it asks resources for some advanced functionality&amp;hellip; but for
SPYING? &lt;em>Are you serious? Spying?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many companies still see spying as a good thing, since selling personal data
makes them money. This looks unethical to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>There are other ways.&lt;/strong> &lt;br />
You can, for example ask your users for feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="buzzwords">Buzzwords&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Buzzwords are everywhere. It isn&amp;rsquo;t really specific to the programming culture.
The thing about buzzwords is that they are usually not needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A funny thing is that many smart people are great at explaining complex things
in simple ways. They also seem to try to avoid buzzwords. The people who use it
on purpose usually do it to look smarter as they are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It might be likely that you don&amp;rsquo;t really understand the meaning of a word, if
you use a buzzword.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We obviously need words to talk, but most buzzwords seem useless, since they
don&amp;rsquo;t have a clear meaning. Use a different word or sentence instead if you can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Try to use words which most people understand&amp;hellip; Yeah, I get it buzzwords often
help with marketing an idea or products and we often use them without realizing
it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="people-who-spread-that-a-programming-job-is-fun">People who spread that a programming job is fun&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Programming as a hobby is fun, but I thought about doing it as a job for a
moment and realized that it is not what it seems. Doing it as a job usually
means that you can&amp;rsquo;t choose what you create.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This takes away a lot of my motivation or interest in the job. They can limit
what you can learn. A company can say you must use this programming language.
The project can be something that you aren&amp;rsquo;t interested in at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a part of a Dual Core song. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get in such a situation.
They even mention that the song is made for all the programmers and developers
in the song.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;quot; I know I go and try but my life is broken, pulverized. &lt;br />
Work and more and more, there&amp;rsquo;s less time to socialize. &lt;br />
And that&amp;rsquo;s just a gamble, so why try and roll the dice? &lt;br />
Either in the office or by myself at home, at night. &lt;br />
Plus I stopped believing, there&amp;rsquo;s no reason keeping hope alive. &amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ndash; Dual Core (Unplug - Listen on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWDCs4tb-7E" rel="external nofollow">YouTube&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It can be a fun job as well, but it depends on more as one factor. Dare to talk
about the downsides when you say that it is a fun job. It can be fun for some
people, but you have to like the full package.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t have a problem with programming as a job, but doing it all day on a
project which does not interest me, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t improve my life quality. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
enjoy that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="my-job-ideas-for-the-future">My job ideas for the future&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I find programming nice as a hobby or for own projects, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to do it
as a job. I could try to become a programming teacher or try to learn other
things which interest me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like to have some freedom. I think that something more creative might be
better for me. I should look into 3D-modelling and 2D-animations and stuff. Art
like that can take a lot of time, but the important part is that you enjoy it.
Programming is not a bad job, but I think that it is not for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Money is nice, but happiness is important as well. Your time is limited. I
recommend that you try to use it in a smart way. Make the best of it.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Not everyone does the things which bother me (and other people);&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="star-trek-franchise">Star Trek franchise&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I never really liked Star Wars it was too much action for me.
Sure it is well-made, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Star Trek focuses more on the characters in a spaceship, less on
action and fighting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is fighting in Star Trek, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t about fighting. It is
about maintaining the peace. I like it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-original-series">The Original Series&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I loved the original series. It was funny and interesting.
My favorite captian, so far is the original one, captain Kirk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also love the characters which don&amp;rsquo;t get that much screen time like
Sulu. I really liked his acting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first episode was also so great. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect to like Star Trek,
but I was enjoying it. It was a pretty clever episode, or at least more
clever than I expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-next-generation">The Next Generation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I liked the original series more, but this was entertaining too. It is
cool that it managed to be alright.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People usually don&amp;rsquo;t like change, so I think that &amp;ldquo;The Next Generation&amp;rdquo;
did a fantastic job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new Characters and parts of the ship are pretty cool. I do like the
Characters of the original Star Trek more though. They are just a bit
more funny, less serious.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="deep-space-nine">Deep Space Nine&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen this yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="star-trek-iv-the-voyage-home">Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The only movie from Star Trek which I really liked. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong
though. Some of the other movies were alright too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first one was not that enjoyable to me and anything after
Star Trek: Nemesis didn&amp;rsquo;t do it for me, but I watched it completely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t like Nemesis. Too much shooting, it feels more like how I
remember Star Wars (much action).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch the movies after 2009. Star Trek ﻿2009 really didn&amp;rsquo;t
do it for me. I even turned it off and didn&amp;rsquo;t watch it completely.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Being different is better than being normal</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/being-different-is-better-than-being-normal/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:10:11 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/articles/being-different-is-better-than-being-normal/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;h2 id="what-is-normal">What is normal?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Normal is the norm, being standard, a regular pattern. Normal is fitting in
with the majority of people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The word normal can mean something else for some people because they see other
things as normal. This article is about the word normal as in living like the
norm.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="my-thoughts">My thoughts&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I believe that no one is normal. Some people just try to look or act normal. I
don&amp;rsquo;t see myself as a normal person either.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="disadvantages-of-being-different">Disadvantages of being different&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="not-everyone-likes-that-you-are-different">Not everyone likes that you are different&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>People might bully you because you are different. You might be an easier target
compared to others. This might be the biggest disadvantage, but this comes with
a lot of advantages as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="haters">Haters&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Everyone has different opinions. You can never be good for everyone. The norm
might have some different opinions which might get you some haters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can try to change people their opinions, but remember that it is not easy
to convince someone. Start with small things to see if they want to be
convinced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People who follow the norm might get hate as well, but the norm is bigger as
the rest. You could get more hate if you don&amp;rsquo;t follow the norm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t try to be different just to be different, dare to be yourself. Being
different to be different doesn&amp;rsquo;t really seems to have a purpose. There are
better (and more valid) reasons to be different.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="people-expect-you-to-fit-in">People expect you to fit in&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You might have to make some sacrifices if you want to be what you like. I, for
example, go to a college which uses closed-sourced software, and I don&amp;rsquo;t like
many things which they teach. You sometimes just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to be who you would
like to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This does not mean that I hate those people. I believe that hating does not
give enough value back. It is probably not worth it. Some people found
&lt;a href="../../about/my-keyboard/">my keyboard layout&lt;/a> pretty cool while others thought that it was weird, but I see
that as a good thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="advantages-of-being-different">Advantages of being different&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="you-are-different-and-stand-out">You are different and stand out&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>People might remember you because you are different. You might stand out a bit.
Standing out might even give you more chances to get success. It takes courage
to stand out so it might also make you a stronger person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Would you rather hire someone with many cool skills or someone who is a part of
the norm?&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="fitting-in-takes-effort">Fitting in takes effort&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Most people their true selves do not even fit into the norm. It requires effort
to try to fit in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It might be easier to use that effort to stand out. Being different is not easy
either, but it can make you more interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="your-views-on-some-topics-are-different">Your views on some topics are different&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is not always bad to see things from a different angle. You might have more

&lt;h3 id="what-if">What if?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You will never see what you could be if will always try to
fit in with the norm. You be even more amazing. It is not

probably something.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Drugs</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/drugs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:09:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/drugs/</guid><description>&lt;p>I try to not use drugs but I am not against people who use drugs. The only drug
I currently do from time to time is caffeine as in coffee or energy drinks. I
would take medication when I get sick which is also a drug.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe that drugs are not always bad and can even be useful in some cases.
It is good for your health to avoid most drugs, but not all. Medication can be
important.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decide for your own if you want to use certain drugs. Many drugs have nasty
after-effects which you probably want to avoid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I currently prefer tea over coffee. Tea can also contain caffeine, but it is
usually not as much caffeine as coffee. Health matters. Time is limited and
bad health can make it even more limited.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ergo Proxy anime series</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/ergo-proxy-anime-series/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 20:51:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/ergo-proxy-anime-series/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

productive. You could try to replace less productive relaxing things with more
productive relaxing tasks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, replace games with watching educational videos or try to learn an
extra skill which you find relaxing. Creating a own website is also something
which you could learn from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Games might be useful if you are a game developer and/or seek inspiration, but
they usually do more harm as good for the most people. You could seek info about
the game instead of playing it if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to waste too much time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are debatable execeptions like educational games or playing games for the
art. I don&amp;rsquo;t find most of the popular games that much of an art piece, but some
games are trully wonderful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Social media is also a timewaster which you might want to avoid. This isn&amp;rsquo;t the
only reason to avoid it. You can read my &lt;a href="../../articles/media-and-social-media">Media and social media&lt;/a> article for
more information.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="do-you-can-something-back-for-your-time">Do you can something back for your time?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Productive activities usually give you something back after a period of time.
Something that you can see as an achievement. Learning something is a task
which returns knowledge. Making a project might even return you donations.
Drawning something might improve your drawning skills, which can also get you
money or respect.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="it-is-all-in-the-details">It is all in the details&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have to admit that I usually also waste more time as I want to waste. Some
things which you might not think about, might take a lot of time. It is
probably also just healthy to not be too busy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about the tiny things which you do. Even putting pens which were inside a
closet in a cup on a desk might help. This makes it easier to get the pen when
you need it. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to open the closet and it is easy to pick up.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="do-something-productive-every-day">Do something productive every day&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Big improvements don&amp;rsquo;t always happen in one day. Working hard can help to get
where you want to be. Do something productive every day. This can be something
simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I try to do a small git commit every day. Not every commit looks valuable, but
you improve something a tiny bit. A lot of tiny bits make something big.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are exceptions though. You could get sick. It is good to push yourself,
but everyone has a limit. You might need a break when you get sick.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="focus-on-one-task">Focus on one task&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many people can work better when they focus on only one thing. Multitasking
often slows you down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Multitasking is not always bad. Listening to music while doing something might
increase your productivity depending on the task and music.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tiny tasks can usually be multitasked in my experience, but bigger ones can&amp;rsquo;t.
You decide how tiny or big, tiny and big is.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why I avoid politics in most places</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/why-i-avoid-politics-in-most-places/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:09:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/why-i-avoid-politics-in-most-places/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;h2 id="people-start-to-assume-things">People start to assume things&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I rather have my own opinions than being associated with what I voted for.
People who disagree with the party which you voted for might hate you because
they think that you agree with this or that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="it-takes-time">It takes time&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Talking about politics takes time. There is a time a place to talk about it,
but I find that it often brings more problems as solutions. I don&amp;rsquo;t even
follow the media, since most things are lies and propaganda. Searching for
the truth can take a lot of your time. I prefer to use my time for things
which I find more important.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are people with which I can talk about politics, but those people are
people who dare to question things. They research to find the truth because
they are very interested in politics. I am just not that interested in
politics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What you vote for is often none of people their business in the first place,
so why would you waste a ton of time on such a topic?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="not-everyone-understands-you">Not everyone understands you&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You vote for things which matter to you. It is possible that you are like me
and that you don&amp;rsquo;t stand for some party. I prefer to think in ideas, not in
people or parties. I believe that you can&amp;rsquo;t completely agree with someone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can try to explain why you vote for something, but discussions like that
can take a ton of time. I think that every party has some problems. It isn&amp;rsquo;t
possible to have something which everyone agrees with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="you-can-t-avoid-politics">You can&amp;rsquo;t avoid politics&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes, that is correct. There is politics in everything, but talking about
some problems usually brings more trouble than it is worth in my opinion. It
also depends on the person which you are talking with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t want to associate myself with some person or party. It is pretty
impossible to not talk about politics in some way. Talking about big problems
is usually not worth your time in my opinion. Unless that person has done
enough research. You also have to be in the right place at the right time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="so-which-party-did-robin-wils-vote-for">So, which party did Robin Wils vote for?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I won&amp;rsquo;t give you the answer, since I don&amp;rsquo;t stand for any party and I don&amp;rsquo;t
want to create a long discussion. I prefer to keep it secret and my opinion
can change from year to year.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Space Odyssey franchise</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/a-space-odyssey-franchise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 20:51:58 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/a-space-odyssey-franchise/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;!--endtoc-->
&lt;h2 id="what-is-an-internet-meme">What is an internet meme?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>An internet meme is commonly known as just a meme, which means something else
apparently. An internet meme is an activity, concept, catchphrase, or piece of
media that spreads, often for humorous purposes, from person to person via the
internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was a bit of text&amp;hellip; you can usually just replace the word internet meme
with internet joke or internet content. The word internet meme is correct, but
the word meme is probably technically incorrect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That definition is pretty unclear. A simple avatar or profile picture is an
internet meme, according to that definition. The internet memes that I wrote
about in this article are the common sometimes funny images and short sometimes
funny video formats of the internet memes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-value-of-an-internet-meme">The value of an internet meme&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>An internet meme usually does not have a lot of value in my opinion. The jokes
can be funny for a few minutes. The fun that you get from it usually does not
last long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Watching a movie might satisfy you more if you want to have a laugh. Some of
the internet memes are art, but most are just the same repitive jokes with
different text. Some of them aren&amp;rsquo;t even funny in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="spam">Spam&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many social media contains so many internet memes that it clutters the content
which you might want to see. It can act like spam for the people who don&amp;rsquo;t want
to see that content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An internet meme often wastes space for educational or valuable content. Images
can make your content more readable, but internet memes also don&amp;rsquo;t look formal
in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-internet-meme-culture">The internet meme culture&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are different types and sizes of internet memes. Many internet meme
communities claim that the internet memes from 9gag and ifunny are poorly made.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Internet memes are often poorly made. There are exceptions, but even most of the
famous 4chan memes are often pretty poorly made in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t often visit well-known chans or forums. I usually only visit pages or
boards about technology if I do.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Internet memes often don&amp;rsquo;t bring a lot of extra value to something. They are
often a waste of space. I might even block them if it becomes possible to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They can be useful to fill up some content, but be careful if you do that. Your
content might look less formal if you do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest thing that I don&amp;rsquo;t like about memes is that they are overrused and
you download them when you visit a page while you might not even want to see
them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also don&amp;rsquo;t like the word. I will try to use the word internet joke instead. I
am not saying that anyone should ban it, since that probably won&amp;rsquo;t work anyways.
The thing about these jokes is that it is an idea which many people seem to like.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Music</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/music/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:09:37 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/music/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;h2 id="what-i-don-t-like">What I don&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I usually don&amp;rsquo;t judge people by what they listen to. I usually won&amp;rsquo;t complain
about your music taste. Everyone likes different stuff. There are some genres
which I don&amp;rsquo;t like though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t like dubstep, hardcore, house and other noisy background beats. Don&amp;rsquo;t
confuse this with Classical music, Jazz or other genres. I enjoy those music
genres. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t like &amp;ldquo;pop&amp;rdquo; either, but there are exceptions to the
rule.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-i-do-like">What I do like&lt;/h2>
&lt;h4 id="nerdcore">Nerdcore&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I enjoy Nerdcore, keep in mind that Nerdcore isn&amp;rsquo;t always hip hop. The part of
the Nerdcore genre that I listen to is mostly hip hop though. Nerdcore is a
culture. It can include many genres.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I almost always listen to Nerdcore when I listen to music.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>YTCracker&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Schäffer the Darklord (STD)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mikal kHill&lt;/li>

&lt;p>I also listen to artists which aren&amp;rsquo;t on the previous list. I mean, I could
mention them all, but the page would get filled pretty quick.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="hip-hop">Hip hop&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>There is a ton of hip hop, which I actually don&amp;rsquo;t like, but there are
exceptions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t often listen to these artists, but I usually play their song once when
they release a new song. I do enjoy their music, but my love for Nerdcore is
bigger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong though, there are a lot of great artists out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The Jokerr&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some artists of strange music:

&lt;p>You have a right on privacy. Privacy means that you have the control over your
personal information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your personal information might be a lot more as you think. It is more as just
your name or email. It can include your shopping behavior, the sites which you
visit, medical info, full-time access to your microphone and a lot more.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="privacy-means-caring-about-others">Privacy means caring about others&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many don&amp;rsquo;t value privacy until they lose it. Caring about other people&amp;rsquo;s
privacy means that you respect them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Privacy creates trust. Trust is one of the most important elements of love. In
other words share the love and give your users their privacy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My biggest reason to care is that I don&amp;rsquo;t find it respectful or ethical to deny
the privacy of users. I care about privacy, since I think that others should
have it. It is a right after all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="i-have-nothing-to-hide">I have nothing to hide&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have passwords if no one cared about privacy. In other words, feel
free to make all your logins public if you don&amp;rsquo;t care about privacy. &lt;em>Don&amp;rsquo;t
actually do this. It asks for trouble.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="privacy-does-not-exist">Privacy does not exist&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some might says that there is no such thing as privacy nowadays. The thing is,
everything is breakable, but you can make it harder. People are less likely to
break something which is not easy to break, since it is easier to break the
thing which is easier to break.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time matters, even for the people who attack other people their systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="they-already-have-all-my-data">They already have all my data&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Old database data can get removed and you change, so the info which they have
might be irrelevant in the future. There is also a chance that some
cybercriminals remove all that data. The GDPR law (Europe only) is also a thing
now, so you have the right to be forgotten.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t you try to give others their privacy, even if they have your data?
Supporting privacy tools makes them better. It makes life easier for the people
who need privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="not-everyone-is-aware-of-privacy">Not everyone is aware of privacy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The sad truth is that many companies spy on users, so that they can sell your
personal data to others. Not only companies do this, some cybercriminals also
post personal information which they find online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even your friends might share your personal data without being aware of it.
Privacy usually requires small sacrifices, not everyone has the guts to make
them. Convenience is extremely useful and making every sacrifice is almost,
if not completely impossible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your choices are not everyone&amp;rsquo;s choices. A bit better is already a step in
the right direction. Not everyone has to be an extreme privacy geek.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="basic-tips">Basic tips&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="remove-things-which-you-no-longer-use">Remove things which you no longer use&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This means that attackers have fewer things to attack, which makes the
chance on an attack smaller.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="don-t-trust-everyone">Don&amp;rsquo;t trust everyone&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Avoid websites which you don&amp;rsquo;t trust. Some dangerous websites are very good at
pretending that they are not dangerous. Don&amp;rsquo;t download or trust every random
thing that you read on the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="passwords">Passwords&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Use a password or any other form of security (PIN, fingerprint,&amp;hellip;) on every
device.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use strong passwords and use a different password for every website.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I highly recommend KeepassXC (GPLv2 licensed) which is a
password database. It generates all your passwords for you.
You only have to remember one password so using it is very
convenient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bitwarden (GPLv3 licensed) is another option if you prefer an online password
database, but remember that online databases can get attacked by other people.
You don&amp;rsquo;t have full-control over this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="use-encryption">Use encryption&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Encryption is another layer of security. It is not bad to make everything a
little bit more secure. I don&amp;rsquo;t use encryption on all my stuff, but I use it
on much stuff. The disadvantage of encryption is that it can make your
system a bit slower.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can compare it to using a secret code to talk to someone. The other person
has to know and decode the code to get the result. Encryption is that secret
code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your system will have to do some math before it can access some file,
since the file is not readable without decoding the secret code.&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="decide-how-far-you-want-to-go">Decide how far you want to go&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Your online information can be used against you. Know what you post, and know
that people might use it against you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Decide how far you are willing to go for privacy. You can make your own choices.
The privacy road is not always convenient. I recommend to at least try to
understand why people care about privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might care more when something bad happens with your personal data. I hope
that it does not, but it is better to be prepared.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="software-types">Software types&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="the-most-popular-types-of-software">The most popular types of software&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are many types of software and knowing a bit about these can learn you
that you should or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t trust something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This part of the article is about the different licenses that there are. These
aren&amp;rsquo;t all the licenses. I tried to keep it simple and readable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="closed-source-software">Closed source software&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Close source, also know as proprietary software means that no one can read the
code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might think that it helps for privacy, but it is actually the opposite. One
line of code is enough to spy on people. More eyes on the code means that
people find and fix the problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The method of encryption can be known, but those functions are so strong that
most people don&amp;rsquo;t understand it and good methods are not easy to break. Some
methods haven&amp;rsquo;t been broken yet. People who are great at math write those
complex methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="open-source-software">Open source software&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Open source means that the source, in other words the code is readable for
everyone. This is great, but many open source things also have downsides.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open washing is a thing. That means promoting a product like everything is
open, but it actually still contains closed source code. Companies like to do
it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="public-domain-software">Public domain software&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Public domain software is open source and has no restrictions, so anyone can
steal the code and sell it. This can be good, but keep in mind that anyone can
steal your code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No restrictions means that you can use it for any purpose. It is pretty awesome
to see when a tool uses the public domain license (CC0).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="free-software">Free software&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Free or libre software is open source, but it has a different goal as
open source software. The goal is to give the users of the program freedom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that many people prefer that you don&amp;rsquo;t call it open source.
The goal is different, and some people find this goal better as
the one which open source has.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t mean free as in gratis. This is a bit confusing some times.
It is free as in freedom. People some times use the word libre to
avoid this confusion. In other words, yes you can ask money for
free software licensed things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People can steal your code like public domain software, but only if they
license it as free software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Libre software has to respect four freedoms. This can make it a better
option as open source if you care about privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="email">Email&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="email-providers">Email providers&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many mail providers are closed source software which is why you probably should
not trust them. There are not many email providers which are focused on privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tutanota (GPLv3 licensed)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Protonmail (MIT licensed)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cock.li - A server which is hosted by one person instead of a company. Use
this at your own risk. Many sites block mailaddresses of this provider.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Selfhost your email. This is meant for the people who have time and can
afford it. It is definitely not always the easiest route.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="email-clients">Email clients&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are a lot of clients which I could mention here. I personally just use my
browser to check my email.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Claws mail, Evolution, Mutt (terminal only),&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The reason that I probably would not recommend the popular Mozilla Thunderbird
client is that it is not GPL licensed. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that it uses a bad license,
but there are GPL licensed alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pgp">PGP&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is something which you can use to encrypt your emails.
It works with a web of trust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use Tutanota, so I use the method of encryption which they provide. I don&amp;rsquo;t
often encrypt my emails, but I try to think what I send through email.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Email is not secure, never send passwords through email.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="social-media">Social media&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is actually pretty funny that social media is in this list. People can find
a ton of personal information on social media. You could try to stop using the
most social media when you are a privacy fan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most popular social media services are known for not caring about privacy.
Don&amp;rsquo;t put everything publicly on social media, since it is free information for
data mining and cybercriminals. I also recommend removing your old posts.
Information can be used against you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t trust that something is private on social media. They usually sell your
personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-fediverse">The Fediverse&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The most popular social media network which isn&amp;rsquo;t know for mining your personal
data is probably the Fediverse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can do a lot, including video hosting (like YouTube) and image hosting
(like Instagram). The possibilities of this network are huge.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="icon">
&lt;img src="../../images/articles/privacy-focused-software/fediverse-logo.png"
alt="Five nodes in pentagon shape with all diagonals, multicoloured. Logo created to represent the Fediverse." width="150" height="150"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;div class="small-font">
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Fediverse logo By Eukombos - CC0 licensed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Fediverse things work with a thing called instances. You will have to pick
an instance when you want to join it. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry though. You can still talk to
other instances and it is not unusual to switch instance after a few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some instances use Cloudflare. Cloudflare does not care about your privacy.
I highly recommend to read my &lt;a href="../../categories/articles/say-no-to-cloudflare">Cloudflare article&lt;/a> if you aren&amp;rsquo;t aware of
these problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Similar to Twitter: Mastodon and Pleroma&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Similar to Facebook: Diaspora (Does not use the Fediverse)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Similar to YouTube: PeerTube&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Similar to Instagram: Pixelfed&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>PeerTube does not have as much content as YouTube, but you can
use Invidious if the videos which you like aren&amp;rsquo;t on PeerTube.
Invidious has the same videos as YouTube.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that the Fediverse still has some problems. The way that it
works is far from perfect.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="chat-applications">Chat applications&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>IRC and XMPP are probably some of the better ones for privacy.
Keep in mind that public IRC servers usually keep logs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Be careful with what you say. Information can be used against you.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;quot; Number three, never trust nobody!
IRC is bad luck when you chat too much. &amp;quot;&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend Matrix or Discord. They both use Cloudflare.
Matrix can be selfhosted to solve the problem, but the official
servers use Cloudflare, so you will indirectly tell others to
keep using Cloudflare.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="browsers">Browsers&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="support-competition">Support competition&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>People compare a lot of browsers, but the privacy problems might be deeper.
I think that there just isn&amp;rsquo;t enough competition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chromium based browsers have a lot of the browser market. I would avoid them.
Support competition instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do have &lt;a href="../../projects/Ideas/#idea-better-browser-engine">browser engine idea&lt;/a>. Feel free to check it out, if you also think that
the currently browsers lack some privacy features and other features.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tor-browser">Tor browser&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The Tor browser is one of the better privacy focused browsers out there, but I
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t use it for everything. It a bit slow. It isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect either security
wise, but it is better as many of the other options.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;quot; Don&amp;rsquo;t bet your future on just a few tools. Even .onion sites can have leaks
too. &amp;quot;&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="abrowser">Abrowser&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I use a browser, no really I use Abrowser. It is like GNU Icecat, but
without the default extensions. The default extensions of GNU Icecat are a bit
too much for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that GNU LibreJS will never work in practice unless some law forces
people to license their JavaScript in a GNU LibreJS way. It kinda misses the
point. The idea is not bad, but it just does not work currently.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="firefox-and-chromium-problems">Firefox and Chromium problems&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Mozilla Firefox uses Cloudflare for DNS, by default unless you use an older
Firefox version. Chromium tracks you a lot, since it is from Google.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google also does some great things for the community, but remember that they
are an advertising company. They make the many of their money from their
closed source advertising service, AdWords.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tracking users helps them with recommending more personal advertisements,
which might increase the amount of clicks on the ads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mozilla also did some good things for the community. I would pick
Firefox over Chromium if I had to choose. Just know that both browsers
have some privacy problems by defaul&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="web-browsing-tips">Web browsing tips&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="basic-tips">Basic tips&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many browsers show the location of a link in the left bottom if you place your
mouse on top of the link.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some websites have malware on them. Don&amp;rsquo;t trust a site which has a ton of
download buttons or a ton of ads and such. Just use your common sense and check
if the site can be trusted.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="know-what-the-attackers-do">Know what the attackers do&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some people are very good at hiding malware or/and stealing your personal
information. It isn&amp;rsquo;t bad to take a look at the things which cybercriminals
try to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Phishing is a thing that many still fall for. You can easily learn yourself
how to detect many phishing attacks. Phishing is when an attacker sends you an
email or something else which is supposed to look innocent, but it is harmful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Defending yourself against attackers is a whole topic, so I suggest that you do
your own research on the basics of defending yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="don-t-accept-cookies">Don&amp;rsquo;t accept cookies&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Cookies are small files which contain a bit of data. This data can be used to
keep your preferences like the language and/or website theme you prefer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those harmless cookies aren&amp;rsquo;t the real problem. The real problems are the
tracking cookies. Those cookies can store your behavior and other personal
browsing data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They might contain any of the following information:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The links you click while using the website&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The amount of time you spend on a website&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The pages which you visit (a bit like your browsing history)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Much more tracking data&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The Europe GDPR law contains something so that people can&amp;rsquo;t collect personal
data through cookies unless they have your permission. This is one of the
reasons why you might see cookies pop-ups on websites. You can decline cookies
and I recommend you to do so.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fingerprinting">Fingerprinting&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is true that extensions make your browser fingerprint more unique if they
interact with more as the browser UI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every browser has a fingerprint which can be used to track
you. It is not easy to do something about this even the way
in which you type defines a bit of your browser fingerprint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Completely getting rid of a unique fingerprint can be impossible.
There is always something which makes it unique unless you use
the defaults of a browser. This is also why the Tor browser is
pretty secure. Many people use it with the default settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can defend yourself against the most common fingerprinting
techniques. A canvas blocker add-on tries to defend you against
fingerprinting attacks which are caused by the HTML5 canvas element.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I personally think that add-ons at least protect you from other
dangers, so I think that you should use them. I have a page with
&lt;a href="../../recommendations/add-ons">add-ons&lt;/a> which I recommend.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="world-maps">World maps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a service similar to Google maps.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="search-engines">Search engines&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many browsers come with Google as the default search engine,
but keep in mind that Google is an advertising company. They
have to do tracking to make more money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some alternatives are startpage (couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the license) and
searx (AGPL licensed). I switch search engine from time to time.
I have used the above search engines, but it is not easy to pick one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>YaCy looks like a great option, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most search engines are proprietary. Proprietary search engines:
Bing, Qwant, DuckDuckGo (the core of DuckDuckGo is proprietary),&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="other-recommendations">Other recommendations&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="phones">Phones&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Avoid phones or use a ROM like LineageOS and F-Droid as the app
store if you need a phone. This might change in the future, the
Librem 5 might become a good option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only use the features which you need when you decide to use a phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Phones collect a ton of personal info. You are the one that
chooses your sacrifices though. A phone is an important device
for many people.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="operating-systems">Operating systems&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Windows and OS X are proprietary, so you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t trust them.
You can use them and many people depend on some specific tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember, it is a choice. You probably won&amp;rsquo;t convince someone to
use something if you push them too hard. They can ask you questions
about your system if they are interested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GNU+Linux and BSD operating systems are the alternatives to
those operating systems. I would recommend Debian or Devuan for
beginners. You can try those operating systems in a virtual machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not going to lie, these operating systems require some learning,
but it is not that hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="other-options">Other options&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>QubesOS looks security focused, but it looks resource heavy.
I also really like what GuixSD is doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use a free (as in freedom) distro, but you have to be sure
that you have drivers for everything. I want to recommend this to
everyone, but the privacy sacrifice is too big for most people.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="keep-learning">Keep learning&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Look at the privacy focused movements, and don&amp;rsquo;t trust everything
blindly. Some of these movements are the FSF, the EFF, defective
by design,&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could write more about this, but I wanted to stick to the basics.

&lt;p>It is about a Time Lord called the Doctor who travels through time

&lt;h2 id="recycling">Recycling&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I like to question things. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure of recycling worked a while
ago. It seems like most recycling does not work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recycling really seems uneffective when you think about it. The garbage gets
moved which costs fuel and energy is needed to process it. How can that even
help and what happens?&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="icon">

&lt;p>The recycling symbol By Krdan Ielalir - CC0 licensed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The recycling which works is usually recycling which you get money for.
Most recycling is a lie. It is sad, but there are still things which
we can do. It is a wonder that many people believe that all recycling helps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not saying that you should not recycle. The garbage has to go
somewhere and it is better for the enviroment if not everyone has to
drive to some place with a ton of garbage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Penn &amp;amp; Teller: Bullshit! has an episode which shows how recycling worked.
You can find it on &lt;a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/j0Hd6UfA4MKo/" rel="external nofollow">BitChute&lt;/a>. BitChute uses &lt;a href="../../articles/say-no-to-cloudflare/">Cloudflare&lt;/a>. I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend it,
but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find another source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that this problem is different for every country. There are
things which do work. I just don&amp;rsquo;t find it ethical to spread lies.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="don-t-have-kids">Don&amp;rsquo;t have kids&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Some people call using less, minimalism. I like that, but not everyone means
the same when they use the word.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean buying things or making decisions based on what
you need instead of what you want with minimalism. It is a state of
mind. This does not mean that you can&amp;rsquo;t have pictures and memories.
You can do it in a extreme way, but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Minimalism has other advantages as well. You can find things faster,
since you have less stuff to look through. Less stuff means
more money. Less stuff means less garbage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Minimalism does not mean that you give up all convenient things.
You can take it that far, but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="take-care-of-your-stuff">Take care of your stuff&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Compare a plastic water bottle and a glass water bottle for example.
You can refill the bottles, but people often throw the small plastic

&lt;h2 id="my-current-distro-is-arch">My current distro is Arch&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I currently run Arch. I don&amp;rsquo;t like systemd, but the AUR has so many packages.
The good sides are greater as the bad sides for me. I have been a long time
Debian-based distro user and I like stability. I also like up to date packages
though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t have installation scripts for my current configuration for Arch. I
have that for Devuan. I might create that one day, but it costs time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rolling-is-not-stable">Rolling is not stable&lt;/h2>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;div class="small-font">
&lt;div>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Arch xorg.conf broke. It is probably public domain licensed, since it is one of
those internet jokes - CC0 licensed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>People often say that rolling is not stable. There is some truth in that, but
I haven&amp;rsquo;t had any problems with that yet. I actually find it more stable.
Probably because I used some specific things like virtualbox repositories and
custom builded packages like Emacs on Devuan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recommend to keep the system minimal. Having many packages causes that you
have a higher chance on problems with broken packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-don-t-like-systemd">I don&amp;rsquo;t like systemd&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I disabled many default systemd services which I don&amp;rsquo;t need. I find that
systemd does too much. It also broke my networking service. I had to
install the dhclient package even though I already had dhcpcd. That fixed
my networking problems. My network manager, wicd worked perfectly fine on
Devuan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know that Artix (Arch without systemd) exists. The problem is compatibility
with the AUR. Most packages expect that you have systemd. It is better to just
use systemd to avoid package conflicts with the AUR.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-arch-way">The Arch Way&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I often don&amp;rsquo;t recommend to install Arch &amp;ldquo;The Arch Way&amp;rdquo;. People want convenience.
Using the commandline to install your distro can be great, but it often costs
people valuable time. Most people won&amp;rsquo;t need most commands which you use during
the install.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong installing it through the commandline can be fast and has
advantages. Many Arch users say taht you should only use Arch if you do the
commandline install. I don&amp;rsquo;t agree.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doing it to learn the commands is understandable, but I would recommend to try
Linux From Scratch in a virtual machine instead if you want to learn much.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Zen Installer provides a full graphical (point and click) environment for

needed packages after your basic Arch install.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Free Software Foundation - CC0 licensed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The GPL license tries to give you the four freedoms. This makes it a bit more
trustable as other licenses.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your
computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is needed for
this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (
freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to
benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a needed for this.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>That is all great, but the license has some things which you should think
about&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-gpl-attempts-to-force-people-to-release-their-source-code">The GPL attempts to force people to release their source code&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It would be great if this would actually work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about it for a minute. What would a closed source company do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They would use the code and not tell anybody or in the other case write code
from scratch. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that that first option would benefit anyone. The
code would stay secret and improvements will not help the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider the same project under another license like MIT or BSD. The company
might use the code, but they are more likely to commit changes back. This can
lead to a better project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-gpl-license-isn-t-easy-to-understand">The GPL license isn’t easy to understand&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The GPL is complex. You are supposed to include a license notice on every file
for example. That takes some effort. You can find many incorrectly GPL licensed
projects online.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="you-have-to-re-release-programs-under-the-gpl-license">You have to re-release programs under the GPL license&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The GPL forces you to release anything which uses the source code of the
program under the GPL license. This means that closed source companies can’t
build a closed source version or new program based on your GPL licensed
software.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-opinion-about-the-gpl">My opinion about the GPL&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I think that people who use the GPL usually have good intentions. I do like,
use and trust many GPL licensed software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe that you shouldn’t trust licenses. Look at what others think of the
software and check the history of the software. The GPL license makes a program
more trustable, but it is still a license. Licenses can be violated. The idea
of the GPL is not bad, but it is different in practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do prefer programs which have readable code because people can read the code
and make it better. Closed source can be bad, but you never trully know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;br />&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if they never do anything bad with the code or your personal data?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does your online privacy even matter? You can find more about this in my
&lt;a href="../../categories/articles/how-important-is-online-privacy">How important is online privacy?&lt;/a> article.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="which-licenses-should-you-use">Which licenses should you use?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>That totally depends. I don’t think that the GPL is bad. It just requires some
effort to implement. I think that it is great for privacy and trust. The GPL
can be a good choice, but please think before you use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that BSD, MIT, CC0,&amp;hellip; are better licenses if you want to be good for
people. Keep in mind that everything can have a bad side. CC0 also know as
public domain means that anyone can steal your program. It has no restrictions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should do some research on the different licenses before you pick one. Make
sure to think enough about it. Licenses can have consequences.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My keyboard</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/my-keyboard/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:09:44 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/my-keyboard/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;h2 id="weird-keyboard-layout">Weird keyboard layout&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The keyboard layout which I use is the Dvorak layout. People have taken a
picture of my keyboard and posted it on 9gag. They did this without asking
because it looks weird. Yes, I know 9gag&amp;hellip; a closed source website which
contains internet jokes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Picture of the Dvorak layout - CC0 licensed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Well, look at it like this. We use QWERTY since people created that for
typewriters so people knew the layout already. A typewriter needed a special
layout like QWERTY since typewriters work with metal arms and those could jam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People created the Dvorak layout to replace QWERTY. That layout claims to
require less finger movement which is also why many people claim that your
typing speed increases when you use Dvorak. I find the Dvorak layout very
comfortable to type on. I don&amp;rsquo;t use it to improve my typing speed. I do touch
type though.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="security">Security&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Not everyone knows how to type on a Dvorak keyboard layout. This means that
some cybercriminals also don&amp;rsquo;t know the layout. It is not a lot of extra
security, but everything that helps, helps.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="world-s-fastest-typist">World&amp;rsquo;s fastest typist&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The world&amp;rsquo;s current fastest typist is Barbara Blackburn. She broke the world
record by using a Dvorak keyboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="possible-dvorak-problems">Possible Dvorak problems&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many people who use Dvorak (including me) forget how to type on their other
keyboard layout (QWERTY for example).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t always a problem. I recommend to get a external keyboard which can
emulate Dvorak and QWERTY. It makes life easier for your colleagues and also
for you when you have to work on other people their machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ergodox-ez">ErgoDox EZ&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I am a proud owner of an ErgoDox EZ keyboard. It is expensive, but it is worth
it. The only problem that I have with this keyboard is that I love it too much.
Typing on a non-ergonomic keyboard like the keyboard which my laptop has is
not as comfortable. I also miss my keyboard shortcuts and layers on other
keyboards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ErgoDox EZ keyboard can emulate other layouts so I can emulate QWERTY.
This is very useful when I have to use a virtual machine. Some virtual
machines are preconfigured with the QWERTY layout. I can use this keyboard
to emulate QWERTY so that I can easily change the default keyboard layout
of the virtual machine to Dvorak.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep in mind that the ErgoDox is not perfect. The thumb keys are not easy
to press. I recommend the kinesis keyboard if you do want great thumb keys.
They are a bit better. Still not perfect, but better reachable. Xah Lee has
written a lot of stuff about keyboards. I recommend to read his &lt;a href="http://xahlee.info/kbd/keyboarding.html" rel="external nofollow">keyboard guide&lt;/a>

&lt;h2 id="does-privacy-matter">Does privacy matter?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes, privacy matters for &lt;a href="../../categories/articles/privacy-focused-software">some reasons&lt;/a>, but how much should we care?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-most-important-thing-about-privacy">What is the most important thing about privacy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most important thing about online privacy is probably security. The
problem is that it often hurts convenience. It is often just not worth
it and you can&amp;rsquo;t always fight against it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="../../categories/articles/say-no-to-cloudflare/">Cloudflare&lt;/a> for example, is hard to fight against. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that it
is worth it. I used to care a ton about privacy, until I started thinking
about the time it takes. You almost have to use unethical things like
Cloudflare, so many things depend on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It feels like online privacy does not exist. Keep in mind that security
does exist. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to give your passwords to attackers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can&amp;rsquo;t fight against everything without missing out on important
things. Phones save every move you make. Websearch &amp;ldquo;Snowden phones&amp;rdquo;
if you don&amp;rsquo;t believe me. Google and other big companies also play with
your personal data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="seek-balance">Seek balance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Make hard for the attackers, but not too hard. Not too hard still means
that your security should be better than average.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are enough people who are less secure as you. Attackers will pick
those victims unless you are a very important person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fighting for privacy often takes away a lot of your convenience. You
might be more productive without caring about all those things. I think
that you should often pick productivity over security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This does not mean that is ethical to take away the privacy of others.
I find that a nasty and unjust move. I respect people who fight for
privacy and I believe that everyone needs privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is just sad that so many things are being controlled. I hope that
GNUnet fixes some of the damage that has been done to the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="are-there-any-good-security-related-tools">Are there any good security related tools?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I do recommend things like password databases, just because it makes your life
even more convenient and more secure. It is worth it. It is ok to choose
security sometimes, but don&amp;rsquo;t let it ruin your life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is not bad to know how you can protect yourself, but also ask yourself of
it is worth it. Security and privacy matters, but so does convenience and
productivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One basic rule is think before you post something on the internet. This alone,
can help you a lot. People can use your data against you.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Choose how far you are willing to go, but don&amp;rsquo;t become too obsessed with it.
Security and privacy matters, but so does convenience and productivity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My GNU Emacs config</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/emacs-config/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 15:09:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/about/emacs-config/</guid><description>&lt;p>You can find my GNU Emacs config on Codeberg.

&lt;p>KeePassXC - CC0 licensed.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="convenience">Convenience&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>KeePass is a offline password database. It generates all your passwords for
you. You only have to remember one password so using it is very convenient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some versions can manage SSH keys for you. Forget all your fast made passwords.
You only have to create and remember one strong master password.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Browser and mobile plugins for this database exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="security">Security&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>KeePass generates strong passwords for you. Passwords can&amp;rsquo;t get cracked
online, since the database is offline. Online password databases do have this
problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most (if not all) KeePass programs are free software and licensed under the
GPL, which means that it should respect four freedoms. This creates some trust
and I think that it was is a great pick for such a program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can read my &lt;a href="../../categories/articles/think-before-using-the-gpl-license">Think before using the GPL license&lt;/a> article for more
information.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="which-version">Which version?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I recommend KeePassXC. It is a community fork of KeePassX.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>KeePassXC gets updated regularily;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It works on Linux, Windows and macOS without modifications;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can import passwords from other password databases;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>TOTP generation (including Steam Guard)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Has SSH Agent integration;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Has browser integration;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Has key file and YubiKey support for additional security;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I would recommend KeePass2 if KeePassXC isn&amp;rsquo;t available for you. KeePassXC
should work cross-platform, so it would be weird that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work on
your system in the first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how">How?&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="use-on-computer">Use on computer&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Install KeePass&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open KeePass&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a new database and give it a master key (+ optional additional
protection such as a key file and YubiKey).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create some entries– enter the username, password, URL (of login page),
and optionally notes about the entry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Save&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="use-on-mobile">Use on mobile&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I recommend to transfer your database file to your phone if you want to use it
on your phone. Many applications allow you to use things like Dropbox to get to
your database, but manual transfer seems safer.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="my-opinion">My opinion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with any of the used names. Linux is the most used kernel and GNU
is a common set of tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-gnu-plus-linux-is-not-the-correct-word">Why GNU+Linux is not the correct word&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Systems with BusyBox instead of GNU, systems which use the GNU Hurd kernel and
many other systems exist. Calling those systems GNU+Linux isn&amp;rsquo;t completely
correct, is it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are also many other things which run on your system. You probably won&amp;rsquo;t
put them all into the name of the operating system. It is just not convenient
to say such a huge name.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-linux-is-not-the-correct-word">Why Linux is not the correct word&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Linux is just the kernel in theory. You don&amp;rsquo;t call Windows, Window NT kernel
and you don&amp;rsquo;t call Mac OS X, XNU.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="from-a-marketing-perspective">From a marketing perspective&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I think that the word Linux often is easier to market. It is obvious that both
words are used to market something. GNU likes the word GNU+Linux, since it
gives the GNU project credit. I like the GNU tools, so I also use that word if
I have to pick one of the those two words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Linux is what people know. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that it is bad to use that word. I
do think that none of both words are correct for the reasons which I described
in this article.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="solution">Solution&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t have a great solution for this naming problem, but I like to call it a
distro. I usually use the distro name when I talk about a system. I use the
word GNU+Linux as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The distro name might be the clearest thing that you can use. Another option is
to just call the operating systems, distros. Distro is also not the best word,
since it could mean a set of software components.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-calling-it-unix-like-systems">What about calling it UNIX-like systems?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The UNIX philosophy was made by AT&amp;amp;T which was a closed source company. GNU
stands for GNU Not UNIX. It provides you the four freedoms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please don&amp;rsquo;t say that you have a UNIX-like system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Monty Python and the Holy Grail movie</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-movie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 17:38:35 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/monty-python-and-the-holy-grail-movie/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;h2 id="geekish-platforms">Geekish platforms&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I enjoy the Fediverse and other geekish platforms. I will stay there. I love
that it isn&amp;rsquo;t focused on collecting your data and spreading fake news. It also
does not have ads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has some disadvantages though. The amount and type of people which you
can reach is different. It is a minority of people. I want to see how other
types of people think as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some people from which I want to see updates, but I can&amp;rsquo;t because
they are not on the same platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ActivityPub protocol still has many known problems, but it works.
I don&amp;rsquo;t mind to use it, since it also has some advantages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One great thing about these geekish platforms is that it does not contain that
much media and fake news. I really like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-twitter">Why Twitter?&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="people-which-i-can-t-reach-now">People which I can&amp;rsquo;t reach now&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I want to see what other types of people are doing and I want to see some
posts of people who just aren&amp;rsquo;t on the Fediverse yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="to-spread-awareness">To spread awareness&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It makes it possible to spread the awareness of the more geeky platforms.
This seems logical. These platforms can be more known. There just isn&amp;rsquo;t
much info about them on other platforms. I will probably remove Twitter
when more people move to the Fediverse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might think &amp;ldquo;Just convince them to use the Fediverse&amp;rdquo;. Well, that is
not always easy and you have to be realistic. It can happen in time, but
the word has to be spread first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about it, just yelling in the Fediverse that it is nice isn&amp;rsquo;t
going to spread the word to many people who are not on the Fediverse yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think that it is bad that it is not that known, but I want the
Fediverse or a platform like it which gets popular&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-twitter">Why Twitter?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I picked Twitter of all those platforms, because Facebook is dying and
Twitter is big enough to be able to reach the right people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are reasons to not use such platforms. I don&amp;rsquo;t often recommend social
media in general. It is a great way to influence people, but it has many
downsides as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://tosdr.org/#twitter" rel="external">Twitter Terms of Service, in a readable format&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, they collect your data. Yes, they don&amp;rsquo;t like Tor users. I do not
support that. I also realy dislike that they block Tutanota mail-addresses.
I made a protonmail account so that I could make a Twitter&amp;hellip; A bit
disappointing to say the least.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>He started the GNU project. The GPL license is probably one of the most
important things that he originally wrote when it comes to free software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The GNU project contains a lot of commands which many use daily on their
system. It also contains GCC, which is still one of the most popular compilers
today. GCC is the standard compiler of most GNU and Linux projects. There are a
lot of cool things like GNU Emacs which are a part of the GNU project.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The UNIX philosophy was made by AT&amp;amp;T which was a closed source company. GNU

&lt;p>Please don&amp;rsquo;t say that you have a UNIX-like system. The idea about free software
is great in my opinion, but it has some bad sides as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t respect stealing code of someone else without asking permission or
without mentioning the old maintainers/developers. I do respect forking it and
changing it. The difference is change. It is ok to fork if you make changes and
don&amp;rsquo;t remove the copyright notices in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="james-gosling">James Gosling&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>James Gosling is the father of the Java programming language. He created
Gosling Emacs based on some other Emacs like things which RMS forked. RMS
apparently stole his code and changed the copyright notices when he released a
new version of Emacs. He modified that version afterwards.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Some claim that RMS wrote Emacs, but he actually rewrote it. Many people came
before him. He didn&amp;rsquo;t even like Emacs at the start, since it was too close to
the UNIX philosophy. James Gosling his version became popular, but he also
borrowed ideas of others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="linus-torvalds">Linus Torvalds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>He created the Linux kernel. I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about him. Linux is a well-known
kernel. Creating a kernel is a huge job, but so is creating the tools on top of
it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>He created TempleOS and claimed that God commanded him to create it. He made
TempleOS alone and even wrote a own variation of the C language called HolyC
for it. He used to claim that he was the greatest programmer that has ever
lived.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TempleOS is released in the public domain, so anyone can use it without any
restrictions. I like to see it as a wonderful piece of art, which you can
download for free&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terry died but, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be forgotten. He was a gifted programmer. Writing an
entire operating system is not a small job.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I find that they all deserve some respect. Computing probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the

&lt;p>RMS, James Gosling and Linus Torvalds worked with a team and many of the great
people who helped them also deserve some respect in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They might all have/had their own problems, but they created wonderful things.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Robin Hood: Men in Tights movie</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/robin-hood-men-in-tights-movie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 17:38:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/robin-hood-men-in-tights-movie/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;h2 id="darkness-is-important">Darkness is important&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You often see only the good sides of life on social media. Nothing is perfect
and the darkness can often make life beautiful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most dark times which I have had in my life, learnt me much and allowed me
to grow and change as a person. Try to see why you don&amp;rsquo;t like your life and
try to change it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can make it through, even though, it might seem impossible. Survive. You
are human.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe that those hard times have made me who I am. I am not mad at people
who have hurt me. I am thankful for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="try-things-dot-hurt-yourself-dot-learn-dot">Try things. Hurt yourself. Learn.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t like how long I am doing in college. Most of it is because some bad
things which happened outside of college.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also realised that Informatica Technology is not as fun as it seems. I
don&amp;rsquo;t want to do task for others my whole life. I want some freedom, which
is why I want to learn design after I finished college.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have to get through it, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t a fun journey. At least I learnt
that it is not what I want to do my whole life. It is a part of my life.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="people-move-in-and-out-your-life">People move in and out your life&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>People move in and out your life all of the time. That brings expectations
and memories. Don&amp;rsquo;t let life trick you. People often don&amp;rsquo;t care as much as you
might think they do, and that&amp;rsquo;s fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-planet-is-fucked">The planet is fucked&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There is overpopulation, but we keep making more children. This planet is
already fucked up enough. People keep spreading lies about simple things
like recyling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People are breaking others off without any great reasons. Being kind to
each other is too hard for many. War is a part of the world. It is a human
thing which we can&amp;rsquo;t control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It often makes me wonder, how human am I? I often allow others to take
advantage of me. Don&amp;rsquo;t let people change you into someone who you don&amp;rsquo;t
want to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-facebook-company">The Facebook company&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t like how Facebook controls so much, but I can&amp;rsquo;t change that. It
is often not easy for people who care about privacy. I don&amp;rsquo;t like Twitter
either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Facebook also owns WhatsApp. I just don&amp;rsquo;t want to support something which
violates so many laws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Look at the app stores. Keeping contact can be hard. I do however believe that
the ones who care about you will try to reach you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do have a Twitter and use a phone now. Adapt. Overcome. Connections are
so important, but so are ethics. Making choices is hard. You have to move
with the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t like the &amp;ldquo;Cloud&amp;rdquo;, but it will be a thing even if I don&amp;rsquo;t like it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="it-s-alright">It&amp;rsquo;s alright&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="you-don-t-need-much-to-be-happy">You don&amp;rsquo;t need much to be happy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You don&amp;rsquo;t need much to be happy. I strongly believe in minimalism. Live
with less, be more happy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is nice if you can do what you like as job, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry. If you have
some kind of degree or enough motivation you will be fine and you can survive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You already made it in life. I know people can often be annoying, but try to
be happy. You are able to do many things which others can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="depression-is-a-part-of-life">Depression is a part of life&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Depression is a part of life. Be yourself, let the haters hate. They also
have less interesting parts in their life. Try to make the best of life.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="why-move-to-wayland">Why move to Wayland?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Wayland is supposed to be more secure than Xorg. There are some other valid
reasons to use it. I moved to it because Xorg broke, and I stayed because it
works.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="which-options-are-there">Which options are there?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>GNOME and KDE support Wayland. There are some window managers which support
Wayland. I use Sway, which is like i3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find some more options on the &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wayland" rel="external">Arch wiki&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-you-should-know-before-moving">What you should know before moving&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="things-which-won-t-work">Things which won&amp;rsquo;t work&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>VirtualBox and VMware don&amp;rsquo;t support Wayland yet.
There is a fix for VirtualBox which can be found on the &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VirtualBox#Cannot%5Flaunch%5FVirtualBox%5Fon%5FWayland:%5FSegmentation%5Ffault" rel="external">Arch wiki&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I moved to QEMU. QEMU is a bit harder to setup, but it can be worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="gui-libraries">GUI Libraries&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>GUI Libraries might need some configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="gtk">GTK&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Many applications use GTK. GTK supports Wayland by default. GTK has a dark
theme if you prefer dark themes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add the following to your ~/.bash_profile (or .zsh_profile if you use zsh) to
use the dark theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">export GTK_THEME&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>Adwaita:dark
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="qt">QT&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Many applications use QT, but QT needs a few things before it works on
Wayland. You have to install the qt5-wayland package for Wayland support.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add the following snippet to your ~/.bash_profile (or .zsh_profile if you use
zsh) to set the right environment variables for QT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is possible to give QT apps a GTK theme by installing qt5ct. Launch qt5ct
and change the Standard dialogs dropdown to GTK.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Enable QT apps to have a GTK theme&lt;/span>
export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>qt5ct
&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Force Wayland on QT apps&lt;/span>
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>wayland
export QT_WAYLAND_FORCE_DPI&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">96&lt;/span>
export QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h4 id="java-applications">Java applications&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The following snippet is needed on some window managers like Sway. Java
applications won&amp;rsquo;t display correctly without that snippet.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Make Java apps display correctly on wms&lt;/span>
export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="multiple-displays">Multiple displays&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some tools which are made for Xorg won&amp;rsquo;t work on Wayland, arandr and xrandr are
made for Xorg.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="wdisplays">wdisplays&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>wdisplays is a GUI to configure the display configuration. You can find it in
the AUR if you use Arch. I am not sure of it exists in the repositories of
other distros.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="kanshi">kanshi&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>kanshi is a tool which automatically sets your display configuration when
you connect or disconnect a display. It works like autorandr. You can find
it in the community repository on Arch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A example of ~/.config/kanshi/config could look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># When the displays eDP-1 and DP-4 are connected.&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">{&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Left display (look at position, wdisplays can make this easier)&lt;/span>
output eDP-1 mode 1920x1080@60.052Hz position 0,0 scale &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Right display&lt;/span>
output DP-4 mode 1920x1080@60Hz position 1920,0 scale &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">}&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># When only the display eDP-1 is connected.&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">{&lt;/span>
output eDP-1 mode 1920x1080@60.052Hz position 0,0 scale &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">}&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You will have to run the kanshi command to run it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="taking-screenshots">Taking screenshots&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You will need grim and slurp to take screenshots. I also recommend
wl-clipboard, so that you can copy the screenshot to your clipboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Take a screenshot, save it and copy it to your clipboard&lt;/span>
grim -g &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">$(&lt;/span>slurp&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">)&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span> ~/screen.png | wl-copy
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h3 id="other-things">Other things&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Most other things should just work. You can run Xorg applications
in Wayland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should look into the keyboard configuration. It is different
depending on which desktop environment or window manager you pick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some drivers and keyboard configuration settings are not supported
yet. You might want to read: &lt;a href="../../categories/articles/why-i-no-longer-use-wayland">Why I no longer use Wayland&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sway">Sway&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I use Sway and decided to place a configuration for it here. Sway claims that
your current i3 configuration should work. It works, but not completely.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="small-note">Small note&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Before you look at it. I use Dvorak the keys
&amp;lsquo;.', &amp;lsquo;o&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;e&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;u&amp;rsquo; are like &amp;lsquo;w&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;s&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;d&amp;rsquo; on QWERTY.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The keys &amp;lsquo;h&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;t&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;c&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; are also positioned like arrow keys
on the right side of the keyboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="configuration">Configuration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I use bemenu to launch applications, which is not installed by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jumpapp is another cool tool which switches to a window if it is open
and opens it if it is not open yet. It is not installed by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i3status is the statusbar which I use. That is why I still have i3
installed. I also posted its config here.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="sway">Sway&lt;/h4>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># CONFIG&lt;/span>

&lt;h2 id="creating-the-git-repository">Creating the git repository&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first thing I did was create a new git repository in my home directory
with a .gitignore file which ignores everything. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to track all
my files. You can do this by running the following commands.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">git init
touch .gitignore

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="creating-a-function-to-track-the-dotfiles">Creating a function to track the dotfiles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I want to track my dotfiles, so I created a function in my
.zshrc (.bashrc for bash users).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second part of the script just runs the function. This automatically
tracks the changed dotfiles after starting a new bash or zsh session.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># function which adds changed dotfiles to git stage&lt;/span>

git add -f $dotfile

track-dotfiles
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">fi&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Make sure to reload your .rc file after creating this function.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Bash users&lt;/span>

&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Zsh users&lt;/span>
source .zshrc
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="using-the-function-to-track-the-dotfiles">Using the function to track the dotfiles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The created function adds every location which is in the dotfiles_to_track
file to the git stage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can track a file by running the following commands:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Add location or file to dotfiles_to_track file&lt;/span>
echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;.zshrc&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &amp;gt;&amp;gt; dotfiles_to_track
&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Example 2: echo &amp;#39;.config/sway&amp;#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; dotfiles_to_track&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#75715e"># Run track-dotfiles function to add the dotfiles to the git stage&lt;/span>
track-dotfiles
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Check which dotfiles you are track by running the following in your home
directory:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">git status
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You can simply commit and push your changes after doing that.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">git remote add origin &amp;lt;HTTPS or SSH url of your new git repository&amp;gt;
git commit -m &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;Your commit message&amp;#34;&lt;/span>

It is a crime comedy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The series (comedy horror) are great. Ash played by Bruce Campbell is

&lt;p>This movie has such a simple story, but the movie itself is so well-done.
It is scary and has dark humor. Absolutely loved it. It is one of the best
horror movies in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is from someone who usually does not like zombie movies, and this
movie has zombies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has the typical gore effects from Peter Jackson though.
Be warned, it contains gore and you might not like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t think that he can&amp;rsquo;t do horror because he directed Lord of The
Rings. This movie is at the top of this list for a reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You probably will like

&lt;p>I found it more like dark humor than horror, but I still love it a ton.
I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend the remake though. I also really love how well

&lt;p>Sci-Fi horror movie francise about a tall man with supernatural powers.
He has epic flying metal balls too, well, more than just balls,
but you have to watch it for more information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ah, a fun fact. The internet character Slender Man was inspired by the
Tall Man. A Nightmare on Elm Street also had some influence from Phantasm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is an entertaining movie, something like A Nightmare on Elm Street.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="the-story-is-just-great">The story is just great&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The movie starts where the last one ended and you discover more and more
secrets through the movies. The main characters are pretty fun too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The story is very interesting in my opinion, just because it has many
secrets. It is also very freaking random, but I loved that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The music is pretty damn good too. The fourth movie was probably my favorite.
Phantasm: Ravager (2016, the last one) was cool, but it also had some bad
sides. It was probably my least favorite movie of the francise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="you-might-want-to-skip-the-first-movie">You might want to skip the first movie&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I recommend to skip the first movie. There are references to
the first movie, but I found it a weak movie compared to the others,
but it is still a pretty great movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a good watch it for more back story. I would recommend to
watch it after the second movie if you want to see it. Life is
fun because of the secrets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first movie deserves to be seen, but I think that it is better to
see the second one first. The first movie explains some of the secrets,
but not too much either.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="it-is-a-classic">It is a classic&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This francise is a cult classic. It isn&amp;rsquo;t super well-known, but it is
known. It is one of the lowest grossing horror films if you compare it
with other famous horror movies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Little Shop of Horrors (1986) musical movie</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/little-shop-of-horrors-1986-musical-movie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 17:40:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/little-shop-of-horrors-1986-musical-movie/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;p>Nothing beats &amp;ldquo;A Nightmare on Elm Street&amp;rdquo; for me, when it comes to
watching horror classics for entertainment, but Hellraiser is not
bad at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This movie is about a puzzlebox which is somehow related to

&lt;h4 id="comparison-with-saw">Comparison with Saw&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>I like these movies a ton more than the most Saw movies. It is a bit
like Saw, but with a tiny bit more story, well it isn&amp;rsquo;t a complicated
story, but it is told pretty well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Saw was good, but most of the other movies just lack story
in my opinion. I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched them all for that reason. You can see
the inspiration from Saw though. It is from the writers of Saw IV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second movie is another gorefest, but it has some interesting
things. It is even less realistic than the previous movie, but the
gorefest has some cool moments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I liked the concept of this movie more than the concept of Saw. It felt
a bit more original, but the story isn&amp;rsquo;t incredible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="what-about-the-original">What about the original?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This is the original. It has concepts which very much are like the other
movies with the same title, but it is another script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are thinking about The Collector from 1965. It has the same concept,
so yes the idea is not that original. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that the movie from
1965 is bad, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it. I should see it someday though.&lt;/p>

Martyrs
&lt;/a> Martyrs is brutal, but not as visual compared the The Collector.
The Collector is interesting, but it is still a lot like Saw in some
ways. Martyrs has a great story underneath, but it is dark.
&lt;p>The Collector is a cool character, but Martyrs is just different.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Warning: this is not a fun film to watch.&lt;/strong> &lt;br />
This movie is &lt;strong>brutal&lt;/strong> and contains some &lt;strong>gore&lt;/strong>, but it has a purpose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is about two girls, one of them was tortured when she was a kid
and she left a girl behind when she escaped. So they decide to go to
the family behind this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t say more, and have a feeling that I have already spoiled much.
The movie starts big and ends big. It already shows that it is a horrible
film in the first shot.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="this-movie-sounds-horrible">This movie sounds horrible&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Yes, that is because it is. You won&amp;rsquo;t see every act visually (honestly
be happy), but the visuals are great and it contributes to the story.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Know what kind of movie you are getting into before watching it.
It is not just horrible. It has a great story too and is probably
worth watching if you can handle this movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t watch the remake.&lt;/strong> The remake is much softer. Just watch the
original it is much better according to many. I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the remake
though.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-story">The story&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The story is a bit complex and the story is amazing. Call me sick, but
I would watch it again for the story and please watch some reviews
after the movie if you didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to understand the movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a really good movie when it comes to storytelling.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="other-stuff">Other stuff&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This movie is part of the New French Extremity genre. This means that
it is very violent, but it has a soul underneath. It is a genre which
most people might want to avoid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is not for everyone and please avoid this genre at all costs if you
can&amp;rsquo;t handle it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tusk movie</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/tusk-movie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 17:42:40 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/tusk-movie/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Warning: this is not a fun film to watch.&lt;/strong> &lt;br />
It is a weird disturbing movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The concept is about turning a man into a walrus. Yes, that is right. A
walrus. The movie had too much sex talk and filler in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It also thinks that it is way funnier than it is. It is not a comedy,
but it has the comedy label. I am not kidding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ending was good and hard to watch. It gave me similar feelings as
the Martyrs movie, but Martyrs is overall a better movie in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tusk is a good movie if you can sit through the filler. I have mixed
feelings about it. I hate the filler, but the story isn&amp;rsquo;t bad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Twin Peaks series and movie</title><link>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/twin-peaks-series-and-movie/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 May 2020 17:42:47 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pages.codeberg.org/RobinWils/categories/reviews/twin-peaks-series-and-movie/</guid><description>&lt;div class="ox-hugo-toc toc">

&lt;h2 id="wall-e">WALL-E&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I loved this movie. I think that some just see it as a childish movie,
but the movie gives you some things to think about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a computer-animated movie about a future in which the Earth has
grewn into a garbage land. WALL-E is the class of robots which is meant
to get the trash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if you see it as a childish movie. It is a pretty good one in
my opinion. I even have built a lego WALL-E as a kid, so yes I am
a huge fan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also know what some of the abbreviations (robot names) stand for,
but it is a pretty useless thing to know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about the ending. Is it actually a good ending or not?
Really give it some thought.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
